<h2 class="nobreak">ON THE EDGE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> far as Jeanne&#8217;s personal life was concerned,
what little was left of it ebbed and flowed to the
daily rhythm of the mail. She felt it begin to
sink lower with the fatigue of preparing and
serving the lunch for the six noisy children,
always too hungry for the small portions, so
that at the last she divided most of her own
part among them. It ebbed lower and lower
during the long hours of the afternoon when
she strove desperately to keep the little ones
cheerful and occupied and at the same time to
mend and bake and darn and clean and iron and
carry ashes out and coal in; her long slim pianist&#8217;s
fingers reddened and roughened till they bled,
because cold cream was far too costly a luxury.
It sank to its stagnant lowest during the tired
end of the day when the younger children, fretful
with too much indoors, disputed and quarreled;
and when, as she prepared the evening
meal, she tried to help the older ones with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Latin declensions and Greek verbs so that they
might be worthy sons of their father. And oh,
the nights, the long nights, when she woke again
and again, dreaming that she saw André
wounded, dreaming that some one called to her
in a loud voice that he had been killed at the
head of his men.</p>

<p>But after midnight she felt the turn of the
tide. In less than twelve hours there might be
a letter. She dozed, woke to make the round
of the children&#8217;s beds to be sure that they were
covered, and noted that it was three o&#8217;clock. In
seven hours she might have news again. She
slept, and woke to hear the church clock clang
out five, and knew that if she could but live
through five hours more&mdash;</p>

<p>In the morning, the countless minor agitations;
the early rising in the cold; the smoky kindling
of the fire; the hurried expedition for the milk
through the empty streets, dripping with the
clammy fog of the region; the tumultuous awakening
of the children, some noisily good-natured,
some noisily bad-tempered; the preparation of
the meager breakfast in the intervals of buttoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
up blouses and smoothing tousled hair; then,
as school time approached, the gradual crescendo
of all the noise and confusion into the climax
of the scampering departure of the three older
ones, blue-nosed and shivering in their worn,
insufficient wraps; the gradual decrescendo as she
dressed the thin, white bodies of the younger
ones, and strove to invent some game for them
which would keep them active and yet allow her
to do the morning housework&mdash;all these tossing,
restless waves were the merest surface agitation.
Beneath their irregular, capricious rhythm she felt
physically the steady, upward swelling of her expectation
as the clock-hands swung towards ten.</p>

<p>Till then she knew nothing, nothing of what
might have happened during the portentous night
behind her, for every night, like every day, was
portentous. There was no calamity which was
impossible. The last four years had proved that.
Anything might have happened since the last
news had come in from the outer world&mdash;anything,
that is, except the end of the war. That
alone had come to seem impossible.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of that great flooding tide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of her expectancy, when the ring at the door
finally came, it always gave Jeanne an instant&#8217;s
violent shock. Her heart flared up like a torch
with hope and fear, its reflection flickering on
her thin cheeks as she hurried to the front of
the house and, her delicate work-worn hands
shaking, opened the door on Fate.</p>

<p>First her eye leaped to see that there was not
the official-looking letter without a stamp which
she had received so many times in her bad
dreams, the letter from his captain announcing
that sous-Lieutenant Bruneau&mdash;no, it had not
come yet. She had another day&#8217;s respite.</p>

<p>She could breathe again, she could return the
white-haired postman&#8217;s &#8220;Bonjour, Madame Bruneau.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next, even on the days when there was a letter
from André, she tore open the Paris newspaper
and read in one glance the last communiqué.
After this her hands stopped shaking.
No, there was no specially bad news. No horror
of a new offensive had begun. Then she
could even smile faintly back at the tired old face
before her and say, in answer to his inquiry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
&#8220;Oh yes, all pretty well, thank you. My own
are standing the winter pretty well. But my
brother&#8217;s children, they have never really recovered
from the nervous shock of that dreadful
experience of bombardment, when they lost
their parents, you know. Of course none of the
six are as plump or as rosy as I would like to
have them&mdash;Michel is growing so fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to thank God, Madame Bruneau,
that they are too young. There are worse things
than being thin and white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Monsieur Larcade,&#8221; she apologized
hastily for her unmerited good fortune compared
to his, &#8220;what news from your sons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still no news from Salonique. A letter this
morning from Jules&#8217;s surgeon. They are not
sure whether he will ever be able to walk again.
The wound was so deep&mdash;an injury to the spine.&#8221;</p>

<p>A wordless gesture of sympathy from her, a
weary shifting of his heavy letter bag, and he
went on to the next door, behind which another
woman waited, her hands shaking; and beyond
that another one, and then another.</p>

<p>If it was to be a good day, if there had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a letter from André, she opened it hurriedly and
read it all in one look, even though the children
clung clamoring to her skirts, even though the
fire smoked and threatened to go out. Then she
set it carefully in the bosom of her dress and
put on the faded caps and patched wraps and
darned mittens to take the children out for their
outing, while she did her marketing. They were
too small to leave alone, even for half an hour.</p>

<p>During the painful experience which her marketing
always was, she felt warmed and sustained
by the letter tucked inside her dress. Everything
cost more than the month before, twice as
much as the year before when her income was
the same minute sum as now.</p>

<p>But André was alive and unhurt.</p>

<p>She looked longingly at the beefsteak which
the older boys needed so much, her own children,
and bought instead the small piece of coarse
pork which must make a stew for them all, those
other children of her blood whom the war had
thrown on her hands.</p>

<p>But she had a letter from her husband in her
bosom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>She priced the cauliflowers, sighed, and bought
potatoes, and less of them than she had hoped
to have, the price having gone up again. She
was horrified to find that rice cost more than
it had, an impossible sum per pound, even the
broken, poor-quality grade. She would try macaroni
as a substitute. There <i>was</i> no macaroni,
the woman clerk informed her. There was none
at all, at any price. Jeanne turned to another
item on her list. The doctor had said that the
children absolutely must have more fruit in their
diet&mdash;<i>fruit</i>! Well, perhaps she might be able
to manage prunes. They were the cheapest
fruit&mdash;or they had been. &#8220;Prunes, Madame
Bruneau? They are only for the rich.&#8221; She
named a price which made Jeanne gasp.</p>

<p>She calculated the amount she would need for
one portion each for her big family. It was out
of the question. She was really aghast, and appealed
desperately to the woman clerk, &#8220;What
do <i>you</i> do?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;We do without,&#8221; answered
the other woman briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your children? Growing children can&#8217;t
be in good health without <i>some</i> fruit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&#8220;They&#8217;re not in good health,&#8221; answered the
other grimly. &#8220;My Marthe has eczema, and the
doctor says that Henri is just ripe for tuberculosis.&#8221;
Her voice died.</p>

<p>Jeanne closed her eyes during the instant&#8217;s
silence which followed. The woman clerk
shoved aimlessly at the sack of dry beans which
stood between them.</p>

<p>Then they both drew a long breath and began
to add up together the cost of Jeanne&#8217;s purchases.
She took out her pocketbook, paid soberly,
and went on to the baker&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Here a girl weighed out for her with scrupulous
care the exact amount of bread allowed for
the family, and took the bread tickets along with
the money in return. At the sight and smell of
the fresh-baked bread the children began their
babbling, begging, clamorous demand which
Jeanne dreaded almost more than anything else.
She winced away from this daily pain, crying
out, trying hastily to stop them before the tears
came,X &#8220;No, no, my darlings, you can&#8217;t have any
now. No, Jacqueline, <i>don&#8217;t</i> tease auntie! Annette
dearie, you know if mother lets you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
any now there will be just that much less for you
at lunch and dinner. You <i>know</i> I can&#8217;t give you
any of what belongs to the others.&#8221; She was
imploring them not to ask her for the food she
could not give them. Anything but that! The
daily repetition of this poignant little scene was
intolerable. If she could only leave them at
home, could only spare them that daily ordeal
of the visit to the bakeshop where their poor little
heads were turned at the sight and odor of
all that food. Not to have <i>bread</i> to give them!</p>

<p>She was almost on her knees before their
shrill, insistent demands when she felt her husband&#8217;s
letter crackle against her breast, and
stopped short. She was on the edge of losing
her head, like men after too long shell fire when
they walk dazedly straight into danger. She
knew better than this! The tragic manner would
never do for little children who cannot live and
thrive save in gaiety and lightness of heart. She
was only making a bad matter worse.</p>

<p>She summoned all her strength, put her hand
on the letter in her bosom, and burst resolutely
into a hearty laugh. &#8220;Oh, children, just see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
funny picture of the little kitten. He&#8217;s chasing
his tail, do you see, round and round and round.
Annette, do you know how he feels! See, I&#8217;ll
hang this string down your back, and you try
to catch it by turning around quickly. See, the
faster you turn the faster it gets away from you.
Maurice wants to try? Well, we&#8217;ll just hurry
home, and I will give you a piece of old red
curtain cord and you <i>each</i> can have a tail and
be a little kitten. And when the big ones get
back from school you can show them how to
chase tails. Won&#8217;t they laugh?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were safe in the street by this time, the
bakeshop forgotten, the loaf in the basket hidden,
the children looking up, laughing through
their tears at Jeanne, breathless, pouring all her
vitality into her cheerful face and bright voice,
so that there was not enough left to keep her
knees from shaking under her.</p>

<p>Back to the house quickly, lest the wretched
war coal, half black stones, smoking sullenly in
the cook-stove, should go out in their absence.
The invention of the curtain-cord tails was still
valid, even after the pork had been put on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
cook with the potatoes. The children were still
playing, still unexacting. Jeanne would have
time to read her letter.</p>

<p>She put the paper-thin potato parings to cook
in an old kettle for their three hens, who occasionally
presented them with a priceless fresh
egg; and, wiping her cold, wet, potato-stained
hands (was it possible that those hands had
ever played Beethoven and Debussy?), took her
treasure out of her bosom and unfolded the
double sheet, warm still from the warmth of her
body.</p>

<p>This time she read it slowly, taking in, absorbing
to the last cell of her consciousness, every
one of those words, written by candlelight, underground,
to the thunder of shells exploding over
the <i>abri</i>. They were plain, homely words enough,
rambling, unstudied familiar phrases, such as husband
and wife write to each other when they
have shared their daily life for many years and
still try to go on sharing what may be left to
them of days in common.</p>

<p>It had rained, as usual, all day long, but the
new trench boots had kept his feet almost dry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Yet he was ashamed of the price she must have
paid for them&mdash;she, straining every nerve to buy
food to keep the children well. He was a man,
a grown-up, and the war had done for them
forever. Let him shift as best he could. Everything
ought to go to the children, there would
be little enough. But they must have the best
chance we could give them. Whoever else was
responsible for the war certainly the children
had nothing to do with it. And they must be
the torch bearers. Did she remember how he had
always wondered why no musician had ever composed
music on that theme? He could conceive
such a noble symphonic poem called &#8220;The Torch
Bearers.&#8221; He had wondered all day if the coal
had finally arrived at Méru. It went beyond his
imagination how she could manage at all, the
days when the coal supply was so low. In their
little underground <i>abri</i> they had a stove&mdash;yes, a
real stove. It had been left there by some American
ambulance men who had used the <i>abri</i> before
them. So they were really warm, part of the
time, and occasionally almost dry. But the wood
they were burning&mdash;it made him sick. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
what his men tore out from the ruined village
houses near which the trenches ran. Of course
it could never be used for houses again, but when
you know what it is to have a home of your own,
and how it grows to be a part of you, it is not
much fun to put parts of other people&#8217;s houses
into your stove. No, he did not need any new
socks. He did not need <i>any</i>thing; she need not
go on trying to slip in some new luxury for him
out of her impossibly small budget. Did she remember
that poor Dury, the youngest of his
men? He had been shot yesterday; a stray ball,
not meant for anybody in particular&mdash;such a silly
way to be killed. And now there was the letter
to write to his mother. Heavens, how he dreaded
writing the letters to the parents of men who died
or disappeared! He hoped little Maurice&#8217;s throat
was better. What a sickly child that poor kid
was! He was evidently one who would have to
be nursed along all through his childhood, and
since the war had killed his parents, it fell to
his poor aunt to do the job. And then&mdash;&#8220;Now,
see here, Jeanne darling, don&#8217;t kill yourself over
that little boy because you feel so guilty at not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
loving him more. He&#8217;s not a lovable kid. His
own mother, poor nervous thing, never could keep
from snapping at him, and you know your brother
cared enough sight more for Jacqueline than for
him. Don&#8217;t you blame yourself. Take it easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jeanne laid the letter down with a little exclamation,
half a laugh. How ever did André
know she did not love the little nephew who reminded
her so of the sister-in-law she had never
been able to love? She had not thought that anybody
could guess that the child to whom she was
always the gentlest was the one&mdash;and here was
André, quite casually as usual, walking into her
most secret places! How he knew her! How
he knew the meaning of her smallest gesture, the
turn of her most carefully worded phrase! How
near he was to her! How there was no corner
of her life where he did not come and go, at
ease, and how she welcomed him in, how she
rejoiced to feel him thus pervading the poor,
hurried, barren inner life of her, which had
bloomed so richly when they had lived it together.
How <i>married</i> they were! That was,
after all, an achievement, to have wrested that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
glory from so horrible a thing as life had come
to be. Let the heavens fall, she had known what
it was to be one with a noble human soul.</p>

<p>She stood up, her thin face glowing, her tired
eyes shining, as they always were after reading
André&#8217;s letter. It was the only moment of the
day when she felt herself wholly alive.</p>

<p>This was the high tide of her daily life, poor,
scanty trickle of life it was, even at its best,
compared to the fathomless deep surge of the
fullness of the days before the war, days when
it had seemed natural that André should be there
always, that they should profoundly live together,
that there should be some leisure, and some music
mixed with their work, and warm rooms and
clothes and food as simply as there was air to
breathe.</p>

<p>A whiff of acrid coal smoke in her face, a
wailing cry from Maurice who had pinched his
finger, a warning half-hour stroke from the
kitchen clock&mdash;she came back to the present with
a start and strove loyally to use for that present
the little renewal of strength which came from
a momentary vision of the past. She changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the drafts of the stove, stirred the stew and, gathering
the weeping child up in her tired arms,
began to make a funny nonsense song, purporting
to be sung by the hurt finger. Her voice
was obliged to pass through a knot in her throat,
but it came out bravely, and in a moment the
children were laughing again, their thin faces
turned toward hers like little pale flowers toward
the sun.</p>

<p>Then there was the table to set, of course in
the kitchen, since there was no coal for another
fire in the cold house. How Jeanne suffered from
this suffocating necessity to do everything in one
small room! It made an intolerable trial of every
smallest process of the everyday life, to prepare
food, and eat it, and play, and wash, and study,
and bathe the children, and dress and undress
them&mdash;they were like pigs in a sty, she often
thought, working feverishly to keep a little order
and decency in the room which seemed to her
fastidious senses to reek stiflingly of the effluvia
of too-concentrated human life.</p>

<p>As she worked she felt, like an inward bleeding,
the slow ebbing of her forces. The good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
moment of the day had come and gone. There
was nothing to look forward to now till the mail
of the next morning.</p>

<p>And this was a good day, one of the best,
when there had been no special activity on the
front, when the daily letter from André arrived
on time. But what of the days when the communiqué
announced laconically, &#8220;Heavy artillery
fire between Fresnes and Villers-Raignault&#8221;?
(André was stationed at Fresnes.) Or worse,
when the great offensives began, when all personal
letters from the front were stopped, when day
after day the communiqué announced: &#8220;Violent
fighting all along the Champagne front.&#8221;</p>

<p>The feeble, tired old postman, shuffling on his
rounds, was a very snake-crowned horror to the
dry-eyed women, waiting and hoping and dreading
to see him come. Always there were cases
of hysteria at such times; old Madame Vielé,
who shrieked out suddenly in the market-place
that she had seen her son fall dead before her;
Marguerite Lemaire, who, returning from Paris
on the night train, had found her husband in the
compartment with her, had kissed him, held his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hand, wept on his breast&mdash;and suddenly she was
alone, with the train rushing on through the
darkness to Méru, where she was met by the
news of his death.</p>

<p>At such times Jeanne braced her shivering limbs
and throbbing nerves to steady rigidity and bore
her burden as though she had the strength of
eternity in her heart. Scraps of phrases from
André&#8217;s letters came before her eyes, as voices
speak to tranced saints. As she worked she saw,
written before her, &#8220;Whoever is responsible for
the war, the children are not.&#8221; Or again, &#8220;We
are all evil creatures, God knows, and our motives
must be mixed in this war because they are
mixed in everything else. But with whatever of
virtue there is in me, I am fighting for what I
think best fit to survive in the world I wish my
children to inhabit.&#8221; Or again, for her own
comfort, &#8220;Dearest darling Jeanne, the very
powers of hell cannot take away from me the
ten years of supreme happiness you have given
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The days went by, one, two, three, four, five,
with no letters, with no words at all beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
steady advance of the Germans. The nights went
by, the long, long nights, not black and empty, but
filled with dreadful lightning visions of what
might be happening, even at that instant, as she
lay in her bed. Jeanne felt no fatigue, no hunger,
no consciousness of her body at all, at such
times. It happened once, after one of these long,
numb days, that she cut her hand deeply, and did
not know she had done it till she saw the smears
of blood on her skirt. Her first thought was
that it was the only skirt she possessed and that
she must not spoil it with her blood, because
there was no money to buy another.</p>

<p>It was that very evening, after she had tied
up the wound on her hand and was beginning
to undress the younger children, interrupting herself
frequently to help Jacques with his Latin,
that she heard the front door of the house open
and shut.</p>

<p>She went as cold as ice. Her heart stopped
beating, her hair stirred itself on her head. It
had come. Some one had brought a telegram
with the bad news.</p>

<p>She put the children on one side, quietly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
opened the kitchen door, and stepped out into
the cold twilight of the hall.</p>

<p>André stood before her, a shadowy figure in
the obscurity, pale, unshaven, muddy, smiling, a
strange, dim, tired, infinitely tender smile. His
arms were outstretched toward her.</p>

<p>For a moment&mdash;a long, silent, intense moment
of full life&mdash;she knew nothing but that he was
there, that she held him in her arms, that his lips
were on hers. Nothing else existed. There was
no war, no danger, no fear, no wonder how he
could have come. There was nothing in all her
being but the consciousness that they were together
again. She was drowned deep in this
consciousness; the blessed flood of it closed over
her head.</p>

<p>Presently the door of the kitchen opened, and
the littler ones trooped out to find her. They
could live but so few moments, those littler ones,
without sucking at her vitality.</p>

<p>She fell at once into the happy confusion of
the usual leave of absence, crying out to the
children, &#8220;See, see, papa has come! See, Uncle
André is here!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>It seemed to her the children were singularly
apathetic, not instantly molten joy as she had
been. The younger ones were even a little shy
of him, who was, after all, an unknown man to
them; and more than a little jealous of him, who
came to share with them their <i>maman</i>, their
auntie, the source and light and warmth of their
exacting little, new lives. It seemed to Jeanne
that they looked even more queerly at him this
time than usual, and that there was in the sidelong
glances of the older ones an element of
strangeness. Their father was becoming a mere
legend to them, she thought with a painful contraction
of her heart.</p>

<p>She found herself talking a great deal, in a
quavering, excited voice, gone back to her old
exuberance of expression. It seemed to her that
she finally asked André how it could have happened,
his coming, and that he explained across
the children&#8217;s clamor that his regiment had gone
down to the gates of hell in the offensive and
that what was left of them had been given a
twenty-four hours&#8217; leave of absence.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, she understood with no further words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
she who knew by heart every way of communication
between his sector on the front and her
door; he had reached Paris by the 3.20 train,
had hurriedly changed stations, had caught the
4.40 train out and reached Méru at twenty minutes
of seven. And oh, she had not been at the
station to meet him! But of course he had not
had time to telegraph. So, if it were only a
twenty-four hour leave, he would need to take
the midnight train back. He had come so far,
so far, for five hours with her.</p>

<p>She thought this all out while flying to get
him some food, to open the can of meat, preciously
kept for just such a golden chance, to heat
the potatoes which were left, to set Jacques to
grinding some coffee, real coffee, such as they
never used, to uncover the sacred little store of
sugar, wide, to his hand! And at the same time
to talk to the children. How unresponsive children
are, she thought; how quickly they outgrow
whatever is not immediately present. It is hard
to remember that four years, so long in the life
of a child, is all eternity to a young child; his utmost
imagination cannot compass it. She said all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
this to André, to explain the children. How absurd
to try to explain them to André, smiling
his deep understanding of them and of her, far
deeper than she could ever fathom!</p>

<p>Then she was driving them all upstairs to bed,
leaving the kitchen to André, the big tin bathtub
and the clean underclothes which she had
always ready for the first ceremony of every
return from the trenches. If only there were
more hot water! But she always let the fire
go down toward night, to save coal. For her
there was no need of fire. She could put a
blanket around her shoulders and wrap her legs
in a rug of an evening as she sat writing her
letter to André by the poor light of the one lamp,
filled with war kerosene, which smoked and glimmered
uncertainly.</p>

<p>She hardly knew what she was doing as she
hurried the children into their beds in the cold
rooms. Hurry as she might, there were six of
them; and many, many, of the priceless, counted-out
moments had passed before she ran down
the stairs, as madly as any girl racing to meet
her lover.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>André was there, at table, washed, shaven, a
little color in his lean, deeply lined cheeks under
their warlike bronze. When he heard her step
flying down the hall, he pushed back from the
table and, his napkin across his knees, a good
light of laughter in his eyes, he held out his arms
to her again, crying like the traditional bridegroom,
&#8220;Alone at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>So it began on the light note, that incredible
good fortune of their evening together, she perching
on his knee, watching him eat, filling his
plate, pouring out more coffee, talking, laughing&mdash;yes,
really laughing as she only did when
André was there on permission. When he had
finished she cleared the table, made up the fire,
recklessly putting in lump after lump of the
sticky resinous coal and opening all the drafts.
They sat down together before the stove, beside
the surly ill-conditioned lamp, and their tongues
were loosened for much talk&mdash;light, deep, sad,
hopeful, brave, depressed, casual, tragic. They
poured out to each other all the thousand things
which do not go into letters, even daily ones.
She heard of the unreasonable irritability of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
captain, and the plain, restoring good faith of
the old colonel; the heroism of the men, the cowardly
slinking back to a clerical position at the
rear by young Montverdier, the son of their
<i>député</i>. He heard of her struggles with the boys&#8217;
Latin and mathematics, and with the little ones&#8217;
alphabet. &#8220;Just think, André, Annette, the obstinate
little thing, will not admit that B&#8217;s name
is B. She says it is &#8216;loof&#8217; and she knows it is
because she dreamed it was&mdash;haven&#8217;t children the
most absurd ideas?&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke out with a Frenchwoman&#8217;s frankness
of her moments of horror, of despair, of
doubt of the war&#8217;s meaning, of revulsion from
the industrial system which had made the war
possible. There deep answered deep; he brought
to her the envenomed hatred of war which fills
the trenches to the brim. &#8220;It is not glorious;
it is infamous. I am not a hero; I am a murderer.
But there are worse things. It would be
worse to have peace, with the German ideas ruling
the world. No, every one of us would better
die than allow that to happen. Yes, I have had
too&mdash;who hasn&#8217;t?&mdash;moments of doubt, moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
when the horror of our stupidity was too great,
when I have thought that any other way would
be better than war. But not since the Russian
affair, not since the Germans marched into
defenseless Russia. <i>Russian children will be
brought up in German schools</i> to form a new
generation of Germans. I would kill my children
with my own hands before having them
added to those ranks. No, since Russia, there
seems no other way but to go on to the end,
and to make that end an end to war forever.&#8221;
The worn phrases, dubious and tarnished on the
facile tongues of public orators, repeated there
in that dimly lighted room by that worn man
and suffering woman, became new, became sacramental.</p>

<p>They clung to each other for a moment again,
and gradually felt the tension of the spirit melt
away in the old cure of simple bodily nearness.
His cheek against hers&mdash;at the sensation she became
just a woman again.</p>

<p>She stirred, she smiled; she told an amusing
story of their queer old neighbor,&mdash;she interrupted
herself to say reproachfully, &#8220;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
I <i>do</i> love little Maurice! I don&#8217;t love him
<i>as</i> I love the other children, but just because
of that I love him more, because I pity him
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said with conviction, &#8220;must be
true because nobody but you would be capable of
such mixed language and emotions.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had laughed at this and, remembering
suddenly that she had a box of cigarettes for
him, jumped up to get it. He was amazed.
Where, in Heaven&#8217;s name, had she been able to
get cigarettes in France in 1918? Ah, that was
her little secret. She had her ways of doing
things! She teased him for an instant and then
said she had begged it for him from an American
Red Cross camion driver who had stopped there
to get water for his radiator. The recollection
brought to mind something painful, which she
poured out before him like all the rest. &#8220;Oh
but, André, what do you think the woman in
uniform sitting by him said? Of course she
couldn&#8217;t have known that I understand English,
but even so&mdash; She looked at me hard, and she
said, &#8216;These heroic Frenchwomen people make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
so much fuss about, I notice you don&#8217;t see any
of <i>them</i> turning out to run cars or distribute
clothes to refugees. Much they bother themselves
for France. They stay right inside their
comfortable homes and do fancywork as usual.&#8217;
Yes, she said that. Oh, André, it <i>hurt</i>! I was
ashamed that I could be hurt so cruelly by anything
but the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>This led to talk of America. &#8220;All our hope
is with them, Jeanne. You mustn&#8217;t mind what
one woman said&mdash;very likely a tired woman too,
fretted by being in a country where she doesn&#8217;t
speak the language. All the future is in their
hands, and, by God, Jeanne, I begin to believe
they realize it! They are really coming, you
know; they are really here. I see them with my
own eyes, not just doctors and nurses and engineers
and telegraphists, as at first, but real fighting
men. They are in the sector next to ours
now. They fight. They fight with a sort of
exuberance, as though it were a game they were
playing and meant to win. And they all say
that their country is back of them as France is
back of us, to the last man, woman, and child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
They&#8217;re queer fellows. They remind me a little
of our Normans and a little of our Gascons, if
you can imagine the combination. Whenever
there is a difficulty they have a whimsical, bragging
little phrase, that they drawl out in their
sharp, level voices, &#8216;Never you mind, the Yanks
are coming.&#8217; It made me smile at first, at their
presumption, at their young ignorance. But
there is something hypnotizing about the way
they say that jerky, unlovely phrase, like the
refrain of a popular song that sticks in your
mind. It sticks in mine. &#8216;The Yanks are coming!&#8217;
The Russians have gone, or rather the
Russians never were there, but &#8216;the Yanks are
coming!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jeanne had been looking at him hard, scarcely
hearing what he said, drawing in a new conviction
from his eyes, his accent, the carriage of
his head. &#8220;Why, André! you are really hoping
that it may end as it ought!&#8221; she interrupted
him suddenly, &#8220;You are really hoping&mdash;&#8221; He
nodded soberly. &#8220;Yes, my darling, I really
hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent, smiled, drew her to him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a long breath, his arm strong and hard about
her. They might have been eighteen and twenty
again. &#8220;And I know,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;that you
are the loveliest and the best and the bravest
woman in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears ran down her cheeks at this&mdash;happy
tears which he kissed away. When she could
speak she protested, saying brokenly that she
was weak, she was helpless in the face of the
despair which so often overcame her, that she
was perilously poised on the edge of hysteria.
&#8220;Ah, who isn&#8217;t near that edge?&#8221; he told her.
&#8220;Not to go over the edge, that is the most that
can be done by even the strongest in these days.&#8221;
&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know
how weak I am, how cowardly, how I must
struggle every day, every hour, not to give up
altogether, to abandon the struggle and sink
into the abyss with the children.&#8221; &#8220;But you
don&#8217;t give it up,&#8221; he murmured, his lips on her
cheek. &#8220;You do go on with the struggle. I
always find the children alive, well, happy.
<i>You</i> weak! <i>You</i> cowardly! You are the
bravest of the brave.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>The clock struck ten.</p>

<p>They went upstairs hand in hand to look at
the sleeping children and to try to plan some
future for them. Jeanne told of her anxieties
about Michel, the oldest, who had silent, morose
fits of brooding. &#8220;He&#8217;s old enough to feel it
all. The littler ones only suffer physically.&#8221;
André put his father&#8217;s hand on the sleeping boy&#8217;s
forehead and looked down at him silently, the
deep look of strength and comprehension which
was like the wine of life to his wife. She
thought it was a benediction to the boy which
no priest could better. André took his watch
out of his pocket and laid it on the table. &#8220;See
here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave this here for
Michel when he wakes in the morning. I only
use the old wrist watch nowadays. It may
please the little fellow to know I think him big
enough to have my watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll make it a talisman&mdash;it&#8217;s the very
thing!&#8221; she agreed, touched by his divining sympathy
for the boy&#8217;s nature.</p>

<p>They roamed then through the cold deserted
rooms of the much-loved little home, unused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
because of lack of fuel, but the wan, clustering
memories were too thick even for their tried and
disciplined hearts. They went back into the
smoky kitchen, shivering.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The clock struck eleven.</p>

<p>As it struck twelve, Jeanne turned back from
the door, the lamp in her hand, the last echo of
his footsteps faint in her ears. She stood for
a moment, trance-like, staring at the yellow
flame of the lamp, her eyes wide. Already it
seemed impossible that he had been there.</p>

<p>She felt horribly, horribly tired, hardly any
other sensation but that. She went upstairs, undressed
rapidly, blew out the light, and lay down
beside little Maurice. She slept with him, that
she might be sure to watch over him carefully
enough, fearing that she might not rise in the
cold so readily for him as for the others. Almost
at once she fell into a profound sleep.</p>

<p>She woke with a start, to find herself standing
up in her nightgown in the darkness, on the cold
floor, in the middle of the room, the cold, damp
wind blowing in on her from the black opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the window. And at once she knew what
had happened&mdash;knew it as though some one had
just finished telling her.</p>

<p>André had not been there at all that day. He
had been killed, that was it, and her intense longing
had brought his spirit straight to her for a
moment, and all the rest she had imagined.</p>

<p>Staring into the darkness, she saw it all with
perfect lucidity. That was why he had looked
so dim and shadowy when she had first seen him
in the hall; that was why his smile had been so
strange. That was why the children had seemed
so queer; she understood now, it was because
they saw no one there and because they heard
her talking to herself.</p>

<p>Did she, then, often talk to herself, that they
should do no more than look sidelong and askance
when she did it? Yes, she must have been
slowly going near the edge of dementia during
the last weeks, and quite over the edge into madness
the last five days of suspense.</p>

<p>A deadly chill shook her, so that her teeth
chattered loudly in the darkness, audible even to
her ears. What did it matter? André had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
killed. There was no meaning in anything any
more.</p>

<p>The cold settled around her heart, an icy flood,
and congealed in her veins. She felt herself to
be dying and ran out to meet delivering death.</p>

<p>She heard Andre&#8217;s voice saying clearly, &#8220;Whoever
else is responsible for the war, the children
are not. They must not suffer if we can
help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause when the world seemed to
be slowly shifting under her feet.</p>

<p>She knew what was coming. In an instant it
came. In all that was left alive of her, she knew
that she must try to go on living for the children.</p>

<p>She turned her back on escape, and in a spiritual
agony like the physical anguish of child-birth,
she put out her hands to grope her way
back to the fiery ordeal of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Her hands, groping in the darkness, fell on
something cold and metallic and round&mdash;Andre&#8217;s
watch, which he had left for Michel!</p>

<p>But if his watch was there, <i>he had been there
himself</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>She ran trembling to the match box, struck a
light, and looked. Yes, there was the watch, and
a burned-out cigarette beside it.</p>

<p>The match went out suddenly in the cold, damp
breath from the window.</p>

<p>André had come, then! And she&mdash;she was in
such a pass that she was incapable of believing
that her husband had been with her for an hour.
Stretched on the rack of long separation, her
body and brain had lost the power to conceive
of happiness as real. She felt now that she had
not really believed in his presence any of the
time. That was why she had fancied the children
looked oddly at him. <i>She had not been
able to believe it!</i></p>

<p>But she did now! It had reached her very
self, at last, the knowledge that he had been
there, that he had been of good cheer, that he
loved her, that he thought the war might yet be
won for the right, that he had even laughed,
had said&mdash;what was that quaint phrase?&mdash;&#8220;The
Yanks are coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the watch up in her hands, laid it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
against her cheek, and began to cry, sweet, weak,
child-like tears.</p>

<p>She groped her way back to the bed, weeping
silently, the watch clutched tightly in her hand.</p>

<p>She lay down beside the unloved little orphan,
whom she loved through pity; she took him in
her arms; she felt the watch cold and hard and
actual against her heart, and, the tears still on
her cheeks, she fell once more asleep, smiling.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FRANCE&#8217;S FIGHTING WOMAN DOCTOR</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> American public has just heard of Dr.
Nicole Girard-Mangin, the woman doctor who
was mobilized and sent to the front by mistake,
and who proved herself so fearless and useful
that she was kept there for two years amid
bursting shells and rattling mitrailleuses. She
is being cited spectacularly as a dramatic proof
that women can take men&#8217;s parts, and do men&#8217;s
work, and know the man&#8217;s joy of being useful.
But she is much more than a woman doing a
man&#8217;s work. She is a human being of the highest
type, giving to her country the highest sort of
service, and remaining normal, sane, and well-balanced.</p>

<p>Long before the tornado of the war burst over
the world, Paris knew her in many varying
phases which now, as we look back, we see to
have been the unconscious preparation for the
hour of crisis. Personally I knew of her,
casually, as the public-spirited young doctor who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was attached to the Paris <i>lycée</i> where my children
go to school, and who was pushing the
&#8220;fresh-air&#8221; movement for the city poor. People
who met her in a social way knew her as an
attractive woman with a well-proportioned figure,
lovely hair, and clear brown eyes, whom one
met once or twice a week at the theater or in
the homes of mutual friends, and who enjoyed
a hearty laugh and cheerful, chatting talk. Other
people who saw her every morning in her laboratory
garb, serious, intent, concentrated, knew her
as one of those scientific investigators who can
not rest while the horrible riddle of cancer is
unsolved.</p>

<p>Those who saw her in the afternoon among
the swarming sick and poor of the <i>clinique</i> of
the great Beaujon Hospital, knew her as one of
those lovers of their kind who can not rest as
long as the horrible apathy of public opinion
about tuberculosis continues. People who investigated
cures for city ills and who went to visit
the model tenement house for the very poor, near
the St. Ouen gate of Paris, knew her as the
originator and planner of that admirable enterprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
whose energy and forcefulness saw it
financed and brought to practical existence. Observers
who knew her in the big international
Feminist Conferences in European capitals, saw
an alert, upright, quick-eyed Parisienne, whose
pretty hats showed no sign of the erudition of
the head under them. Friends knew her as the
gently bred woman who, although driven by no
material necessity, renounced the easy, sheltered,
comfortable life of the home-keeping woman for
an incessant, beneficent activity, the well-ordered
regularity of which alone kept it from breaking
down her none too robust health. And those
intimates who saw her in her home, saw her the
most loved of sisters and daughters, the most
devoted of mothers, adored by the little son to
whom she has been father and mother ever since
he was four years old.</p>

<p>No one dreamed of war, but if the very day
and hour had been known for years, Dr. Girard-Mangin
could hardly have prepared herself more
completely for the ordeal. Unconsciously she
had &#8220;trained&#8221; for it, as the runner trains for
his race. She was not very strong, slightly built,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with some serious constitutional weakening, but
she filled every day full to the brim with exacting
and fatiguing work. She had two great factors
in her favor. One of them was that enviable
gift which Nature gives occasionally to remarkable
people, the capacity to live with very little
sleep. The other is even more noteworthy in a
doctor&mdash;in whom close acquaintance with the
laws of health seems often to breed contempt.</p>

<p>Dr. Girard-Mangin is that rare bird, a doctor
who believes profoundly, seriously, in the advice
which she gives to others, in the importance of
those simple, humdrum laws of daily health
which only very extraordinary people have the
strength of mind to obey. Never, never, she
says, as though it were a matter of course, has
she allowed fatigue, or overoccupation, or
inertia, or boredom to interfere with her early
morning deep-breathing and physical exercises,
and her tonic cold bath. Never, never, no matter
how long or exhausting the day, has she rolled
into bed, dead beat, too tired to go through the
simple processes of the toilet, which make sleep
so much more refreshing. No matter how absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in her work, she has always taken the
time at regular intervals to relax, to chat sociably
with quite ordinary people, to go to the theater,
to hear music. She has always breakfasted and
lunched with her little boy, has steered him
through his spelling and arithmetic, has gone on
walks with him, has been his comrade and &#8220;pal.&#8221;
This has been as good for her as for him,
naturally. Every summer she has had the courageous
good sense to take a vacation in the
country. In short, she is a doctor who takes to
her own heart the advice about rational life
which doctors so often reserve for their patients.</p>

<p>To this woman, tempered to a steel-like
strength by self-imposed discipline and by a
regular, well-ordered life, came the great summons.
And it found her ready to the last nerve
in her strong, delicate little hand. You have
read, probably, how on that &#8220;Day of Doom&#8221;
when France called out her men, a <i>concierge</i>
received, among mobilization papers for all the
men in the big apartment house, one sending Dr.
Girard-Mangin (presumably also a man, by the
name) out to a military hospital in the Vosges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
mountains. The notice of mobilization was
handed to a woman, a patriotic woman who long
ago had heard the call to fight for France&#8217;s best
interests. She had seen her brother go before
her into the fighting ranks and she followed him,
into danger and service. She said a quick
good-by to her friends, to her parents, to her
son, her only child, a fine boy of fourteen then,
from whom she had never before been separated.</p>

<p>Will every mother who reads these lines stop
here and think what this means?</p>

<p>There is no need to repeat in detail here what
has already been told of the first three months of
her service&mdash;her arrival at the field hospital,
disorganized, submerged by the terrible, ever-renewed
flood of wounded men, of the astonishment
of the doctor in charge. &#8220;What, a woman!
This is no place for a woman. But, good God!
if you know anything about surgery, roll up your
sleeves and stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>There she stayed for three months, those blasting
first three months of the war, when French
people put forth undreamed-of strength to meet
a crisis of undreamed-of horror. Out there in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that distant military hospital, toiling incessantly
in great heat, with insufficient supplies, bearing
the mental and moral shock of the first encounter
with the incredible miseries of war, that modern,
highly organized woman, separated for the first
time from her family, from her child, fearing
everything for them and for her country, had
no word, no tidings whatever, till the 28th of
August. Then no knowledge of her son, of her
parents, only a notice that the Government had
retreated from Paris to Bordeaux! Comforting
news that, for the first! Next they knew that
Rheims was taken. Then one of the men whose
wounds she dressed told her that he had been
able to see the Eiffel Tower from where he fell.
This sounded as though the next news could be
nothing but the German entry into Paris.</p>

<p>All France throbbed with straining, despairing
effort, far beyond its normal strength, during
those first three months; and to do the man&#8217;s
part she took, the delicate woman doctor, laboring
incessantly among the bleeding wrecks of
human bodies, needed all her will-power to pull
her through.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Then the wild period of fury and haste and
nervous, emotional exaltation passed, and France
faced another ordeal, harder for her temperament
even than the first fierce onset of the
unequal struggle&mdash;the long period of patient endurance
of the unendurable. The miracle of the
Marne had been wrought; Paris was saved; the
sting and stimulant of immediate, deadly danger
was past; the fatigue from the supernatural
effort of those first months dimmed every eye,
deadened all nerves. Then France tapped another
reservoir of national strength and began patiently,
constructively to &#8220;organize&#8221; the war.
And that daughter of France bent her energies
to help in this need, as in the first.</p>

<p>A rough rearrangement of competences was
attempted everywhere on the front. Dentists no
longer dug trenches, bakers were set to baking
instead of currying horses, and expert telegraphers
stopped making ineffectual efforts to
cook. It came out then that the real specialty
of the valiant little woman doctor who had been
doing such fine work in the operating-room was
not surgery at all. &#8220;I&#8217;m no surgeon, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
know!&#8221; she says, and leaves it to her friends to
tell you of the extraordinary record of her efficiency
in that field, the low percentage of losses
in her surgical cases. If you mention this, she
says, &#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s just because I&#8217;m <i>not</i> a born
surgeon. I have to take very special care of my
cases to be equal to the job.&#8221; It was discovered
that her great specialty was contagious diseases.
There was great need for a specialist of that
sort out at Verdun, where, alas! a typhoid epidemic
had broken out. This was before the
extra precautions about inoculations, which were
taken later.</p>

<p>Dr. Girard-Mangin was sent to Verdun on
November 1st, 1914, and was there steadily for
more than a year, until the 28th of February,
1916. She found her sick men on mattresses, in
tents, on such low ground that they were often
literally in water. Whenever there was freezing
weather, those who cared for them slid about on
sheets of ice. Above them, on higher ground,
were some rough old barracks, empty, partly
remodeled, said to have been left there by the
Prussians in 1871. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we move the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sick up there?&#8221; she asked, and was met by all
the usual dragging, clogging reasons given by
administrative inertia.</p>

<p>The sheds were not ready to occupy; there
were no expert carpenters to get them ready; it
would be impossible to heat them; no order for
the change had come from Headquarters&mdash;furthermore,
a reason not mentioned, the sheds,
being on higher ground, were more exposed to
shell-fire. Dr. Girard-Mangin had had some
experience with administrative inertia in her
struggles for better housing for the poor; and
long before the war she had known what it was
to put herself voluntarily in danger&mdash;the scar
from a bad tubercular infection on her hand is
the honorable proof of that. She knew that the
sick men would be better off in the barracks on
higher ground. So she took them there. Just
like that.</p>

<p>She was to have the entire care of the typhoid
epidemic, and the only help which could be given
her was to come from twenty men, absolutely
unassorted&mdash;such a score as you would gather
by walking down any street and picking up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
first twenty men you met. There were several
farm-laborers, a barber, an accountant, miscellaneous
factory hands. The only person remotely
approaching a nurse was a man who had
had the training for a pharmacist, but as he had
never been able to stay sober long enough to
take his examinations, you may not be surprised
that he was the least useful of them
all.</p>

<p>These twenty casually selected human beings
went unwillingly up the hill toward the barracks,
ironic, mocking, lazy, indifferent, as human
beings unelectrified by purpose are apt to be.
But, although they did not know it, there
marched at their head an iron will, a steel-like
purpose, and an intelligence which was invincible.
They took this to be but a smallish,
youngish woman in uniform, and were all in
great guffaws at the comic idea of being under
her orders.</p>

<p>Of course, to begin with, she did not know one
of her men from another, but she studied them
closely as they worked, driven along by her direction,
setting up the rough camp-stoves, stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the worst of the holes in the walls, arranging
the poor apologies for mattresses, and cutting
off the tops of gasoline-cans for heating water&mdash;for
our woman doctor was asked to take care of
several hundred typhoid cases and was not provided
with so much as a bowl that would hold
water. Presently, as they worked, she noticed
that there were but nineteen men there. All day
she studied their faces, their bearing, what was
written on them for the seeing eye to read. At
night, at supper-time, there were twenty men.
Those clear brown eyes swept around the circle
and pounced on a mild-looking <i>poilu</i> innocently
taking his soup with the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been all day?&#8221; she asked
him.</p>

<p>He fairly turned pale with astonishment,
&#8220;Why, how did you&mdash;? I&#8217;ve been right here,
working!&#8221; he tried to bluster her down.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you haven&#8217;t. You haven&#8217;t been here
since a quarter past ten this morning,&#8221; she assured
him.</p>

<p>He hung his head a moment, then looked an
ugly defiance. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been in to Verdun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
spend the day with a friend. What are you
going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have you punished for disobeying
an officer,&#8221; she said promptly, though so
little military had been her beneficent life, that
she had no more idea than you or I or any other
woman would have of what punishment could
be given in such a case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Officer&#8217;s orders!&#8221; said the man. &#8220;<i>What</i>
officer?&#8221; All the men laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your officer,&#8221; she said, and went away
to telephone to the military authority in charge
of such cases.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be expected to have discipline if I&#8217;m
not backed up,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is a test case.
It&#8217;s now or never.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was a non-com and a guard
marching up to the barracks, saluting the military
doctor, and, with all due military ceremony,
carrying off the offender for a week in prison.
Dr. Girard-Mangin laughs still at the recollection
of the consternation among the nineteen
who were left. &#8220;I never had any trouble about
<i>discipline</i>, after that,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
there were the utter incompetents to be weeded
out. For that I followed the time-honored army
custom of sending my worst man whenever the
demand from Headquarters came for a good,
competent person to be sent to other work!
Before long I had reduced the force of nurses
to twelve. Those twelve I kept for all the time
of my service there, and we parted at the end
old friends and tried comrades. I have never
lost track of them since. They always write me
once in a while, wherever they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as it grew dark enough, that first
night, for the ambulances to dash out through
the blackness, over the shell-riddled roads to the
<i>abris</i>, close to the front, the stricken men began
to come in. Before dawn, that very first night,
there were fifty-five terrible typhoid cases
brought into the bare sheds. Then it was that
Dr. Girard-Mangin, working single-handed with
her score of crude, untrained helpers, needed all
her capacity for going without sleep. Then it
was that her men, seeing her at work, stopped
laughing because she was a woman and admired
her because she was a woman doing wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
things; then, best of all, forgot that she
was a woman, and took her simply for the
matchless leader that she is, in the battle against
disease. I think it was not wholly the guard,
marching away the disobedient man to prison, who
was responsible for the fact that our little woman
doctor had no further difficulty with discipline.</p>

<p>The condition of the typhoid patients was harrowing
beyond words. A man going out with
his squad to a front-line trench would be stricken
down with fever on arriving. It was impossible
for him to return until his squad was relieved
and he could be carried to the rear on a comrade&#8217;s
back. There he was, there he must remain,
for the three or four or five days of his
squad&#8217;s &#8220;turn&#8221; in the front lines. Can you
imagine the condition of a man with typhoid
fever, who has lain in a trench in the mud for
four days, with no shelter from the rain or
snow but an overcoat spread over him, with no
care beyond an occasional drink of water from
a comrade&#8217;s flask? For your own sake I hope
you can not imagine it. And I will not go into
details. Enough to say that such men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
brought in by the tens, by the twenties, by the
fifties, filthy beyond words, at the limit of exhaustion,
out of their heads with weakness and
fever and horror.</p>

<p>And there to stem that black tide of human
misery stands this little upright, active, valiant,
twentieth-century woman. I think, although we
are not of her nation, we may well be proud of
her as a fellow-being who had voluntarily renounced
ease to choose the life which had made
her fit to cope with the crisis of that night&mdash;and
of the more than four hundred days and nights
following. For cope with it she did, competently,
resolutely, <i>successfully</i>. &#8220;Oh yes, we gave them
cold baths,&#8221; she says, when you ask for
details. &#8220;We managed somehow. They had all
the right treatment, cold baths, wet packs, injections,
the right food&mdash;everything very primitive
at first, of course, but everything you ever do
for typhoid anywhere. Our percentage of losses
was very low always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how? <i>How?</i> How did you manage?&#8221;
you ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, at the beginning everything was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rough. We had only one portable galvanized-iron
bathtub. Since they were all so badly infected,
there was less danger in bathing them all
in the same tub than in not fighting the fever
that way. And then, just as soon as I could
reach the outside world by letter, I clamored for
more, and they were sent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could you, single-handed, give cold
baths to so many men? It&#8217;s a difficult matter,
giving a cold bath to a typhoid patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t single-handed. I had my twelve
soldier-nurses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Nurses</i>,&#8217; you say! Farm-laborers, accountants,
barbers, drunken druggists!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I got rid of that good-for-nothing
pharmacist at once! And the others&mdash;the twelve
good ones&mdash;they learned what to do. They
learned how to give the simple remedies. They
learned how to do the other things enough to
give me a report&mdash;how to take temperatures, how
to give the baths at the right degree for the right
time, how to take the pulse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could they learn all that?&#8221; you ask,
amazed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&#8220;I taught them,&#8221; says Dr. Girard-Mangin,
slightly surprised, in the simplest, most matter-of-fact
tone.</p>

<p>You look past her, out there to that hand-to-hand
struggle with death which was carried on
by the one indomitable will and the one well-trained
mind, strong enough not only to animate
this woman&#8217;s body before you, but those other
bodies and ignorant, indocile minds.</p>

<p>&#8220;They did it very well, too,&#8221; she assures you,
and you do not doubt her.</p>

<p>That woman could teach anybody to do anything.</p>

<p>You come back to details. &#8220;But how could
you get enough water and heat it for so many
baths, on just those rough, small, heating-stoves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we were at it all the time, practically,
day and night. We cut the tops off those big
gasoline-cans the automobilists use, and stood
one on every stove up and down the barracks.
There wasn&#8217;t a moment when water wasn&#8217;t being
heated, or used, or carried away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What could you do about intestinal hemorrhages?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
you ask. &#8220;You must have had many,
with such advanced cases. Your farm-hand
nurses couldn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never tried to teach them how to handle
any real crisis, only to recognize it when it came,
and go quickly to fetch me. I taught them to
watch carefully and at the first sign of blood on
their patients&#8217; clothing or on the mattress, to take
the knapsack out from under the sick man&#8217;s
head&mdash;they had no other pillow, of course&mdash;to
lay him down flat, and then to run and call me,
from wherever I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have had almost no sleep at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the greatest help I had, being able
to get along on little sleep. And I got more
work out of my helpers than any man could, for
they were ashamed to ask to sleep or rest, seeing
that a woman, half their size, could still keep
going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how about your famous hygienic regularity,
the morning exercises and cold baths
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as soon as I saw I was in for a long
period of regular service, I took the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
care to go on with all the things which keep one
fit for regular service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morning tubs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, morning tubs! I slept&mdash;what time I
had to sleep&mdash;in an abandoned peasant&#8217;s house
in an evacuated village near the hospital. I
didn&#8217;t take any of the downstairs rooms because
people are likely to walk right into an abandoned
house, and part of the time there were soldiers
quartered in the village. Then there was usually
somebody in the house with me. The other
times I had it all to myself. I took a room on
the second floor. It happened to have a flight
of steps leading up to it, and another one going
out of it into the attic. Of course, I never had
any heat, and the drafts from those two open
stairways&mdash;well, it was like sleeping in the middle
of a city square. Sometimes I used to take
down a bottle filled with hot water, but the bed
was so cold that it was almost instantly chilled.
Many a time I have gone to sleep, all curled up
in a ball, holding my feet in my hands, because
they were so cold, and wakened to find them still
as icy. Oh, the cold! That is the worst enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of all at the front, the most wearing, the most
demoralizing, the most dehumanizing, because it
<i>lasts</i> so. With other things&mdash;hunger, wounds,
danger&mdash;either it kills you, or it passes. But
the cold is always there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She loses herself for a moment in brooding
recollection and you wonder if Jeanne d&#8217;Arc
ever did anything braver for her country than
did this delicate, stout-hearted modern woman,
sleeping alone for months and months in bitter
cold in a deserted house in a deserted village.</p>

<p>She comes back to the present. &#8220;And it was
there that I took my morning tubs!&#8221; she says
with an amused smile. &#8220;Of course the water
froze hard into a solid lump. So I put <i>carbonate
de potasse</i> into it. This not only kept it from
freezing, but made it alkaline, so that it was an
excellent detergent and stimulant to the skin. I
assure you, after a night in which I had been
incessantly called from one bed to another, when
I felt very much done-up, my cold sponge-bath
in that water was like a resurrection. I was
made over. Then, of course, no matter how busy
I was, I took care of my feet&mdash;changed my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
stockings and shoes every day. Feet are one&#8217;s
weakest point in a long pull like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>You venture to remark about a slight limp
noticeable when she walks. &#8220;Yes, it comes from
a frozen foot&mdash;I have to admit it. But it&#8217;s really
not my fault. That was later, at the time of the
battle at Verdun. There are always brief crises,
when you have to give your all and not stop to
think. I went nine days then without once
taking off my shoes. I hadn&#8217;t my other
pair by that time. The <i>Boches</i> had them,
probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>But we have not come to that terrific epic, as
yet. Before that second tornado burst over the
heads of the French and of our woman doctor,
there was a long, hard, dull period of four hundred
and seventy days of continuous service&mdash;for
Dr. Girard-Mangin, being a pioneer woman,
felt in honor bound to do more than a man would
do. In the three years and more of her war
service, she has had just three weeks&#8217; furlough,
seven days out of every year to see her son, to
see her family, to relax. Every other day of
that long procession of days, she has been on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
duty, active, and, as befits a woman, constructively
active.</p>

<p>She did not continue resignedly to struggle
with tin-can drinking-cups, and one bathtub for
two hundred men. Neither did she rely on the
proverbially slow mills of the Government to
grind her out the necessary supplies. She was
not only the army doctor in charge of the contagious
cases in the big sanitary section and
hospital near Verdun, she was also a figure of
international importance, the <i>Présidente</i> of the
Hygiene Department of the <i>Conseil International
des Femmes</i>&mdash;her predecessor had been Lady
Aberdeen; she was high in honor at the big
Beaujon Hospital in Paris; she was well-known
to the charitable world in the Society for Hygienic
Lodgings for the poor, which owed so
much to her; and she had a wide circle of friends
everywhere. The little <i>aide major</i> sent out from
her bare shed-hospital, lacking in everything, a
clarion call for help for her sick men. With
years of experience in organization back of her,
she set to work and, in the midst of the fury of
destruction all about her, built up, item by item,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a little corner of order and competent activity.
In November, 1914, there was nothing but a
windswept shed, with straw pallets and tin-can
utensils. By June of the next year you would
have found, if you had had the courage to go
within two kilometers of the front line, a very
well-appointed contagious ward of a military hospital,
where nothing was lacking for the men&#8217;s
comfort&mdash;except a certainty that the whole thing
might not be blown to pieces by a shell. And
by the end of 1915, when there began to be talk
of a great German drive against Verdun, the
men under our doctor&#8217;s supervision had as good
care as they could have had anywhere, with
laboratory and sterilizing facilities&mdash;everything.
Dr. Girard-Mangin knew what was the best to
be had in hospitals and she did not rest until
somehow, Aladdin-like, she had made it to blossom,
out there in danger and desolation.</p>

<p>All during January of 1916 there was terrific
tension along that front. The monster German
offensive against Verdun was in the air. The
month of January passed with desperate slowness,
such intent, apprehensive suspense being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
torturing for human nerves, especially tired human
nerves which had already been through a
long, severe period of trial.</p>

<p>Everybody showed signs of nervousness. Our
little doctor stuck faithfully to her bedrock principles
of health, changed her shoes and stockings
every day, took her Spartan baths and rub-downs
in her colder-than-freezing water, went
through her deep-breathing and her setting-up
exercises every morning. By such merely
feminine reliance on everyday sanity in life, she
kept herself in excellent physical shape, and did
not succumb to the temptation, which is too
much for so many doctors under strain, of hypodermics
of strychnin, and other stimulants.</p>

<p>February 1st came. The great storm, looming
murkily, had not burst.</p>

<p>February inched itself along, and finally, because
human nature can only stand about so
much of strain, nerves began to relax in utter
fatigue.</p>

<p>On February 21st, which was a Monday, it
was fairly clear, cold, with what passes for
sunshine in that region. Dr. Girard-Mangin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
stepped out in front of her shed-hospital ward,
after lunch, and made this remark to herself:
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe the <i>Boches</i> are going to pull
off that offensive at all. And to-day is almost
sunny. I have a good notion to go over to the
165th and get my hair washed.&#8221; There was an
ex-coiffeur in that regiment who kept on with
his trade in his leisure moments.</p>

<p>As this singularly peace-time thought passed
through her mind, an <i>obus</i> screamed its way
loudly over her head. &#8220;That&#8217;s near,&#8221; she
thought, &#8220;nearer than they generally are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she could get back into the hospital,
the battle of Verdun had begun.</p>

<p>The blow was delivered with astounding rapidity,
and with stunning force. Up to that
time, nothing had ever been conceived like the
violence of the artillery fire. There in the hospital,
only two kilometers back of the front, the
noise was so great they could scarcely hear each
other&#8217;s voices. Upon those men, and that
woman, unnerved by six weeks of nerve-racking
suspense, the great crisis leaped with murderous
fury. It was as though the world were being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
battered to pieces about their heads. Each one
called up in himself all the reserve strength his
life had given him and, tight-lipped, clung as
best he could to self-control.</p>

<p>The first nerves to give way were in the bakeshop.
The bakers suddenly burst out of their
overheated cell and, half-naked in that sharp
cold, clad only in their white-linen aprons and
trousers, fled away, anywhere, away, out of that
hell. One of the doctors, seeing this beginning
of the panic, shouted out in an angry attempt
to stem the tide of fear, &#8220;Shame on you, men!
What are you doing! What would happen if
every one ran away!&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the fleeing bakers, dodging with agility
the outstretched restraining arms, called out
heartily, with a strong Southern accent, &#8220;Right
you are, doctor, perfectly right!&#8221; and continued
to run faster than ever. Which typically <i>Midi</i>
phrase and action was seized upon by those gallant
French hearts for the laugh which is the
Gallic coquetry in the face of danger.</p>

<p>But even they could not smile at what they
next saw. At four o&#8217;clock that afternoon began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the spectacle, awful to French eyes, of regiments
of <i>chasseurs</i> fleeing toward the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;So inconceivable was this to me, that I repeated,
&#8216;<i>Chasseurs!</i> Retreating!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Girard-Mangin closed her eyes a moment
as if she saw them again. &#8220;Oh, yes, retreating&mdash;and
no wonder! All their equipment gone, no
guns, no ammunition, no grenades, no bayonets&mdash;their
bare fists, and those bleeding, for weapons.
Many of them were naked, yes, literally
naked, except for their leather cartridge belts.
Everything made of cloth had been blown from
their bodies by the air-pressure from exploding
shells. Many of them were horribly wounded,
although they were staggering along. I remember
one man, whose wounds we dressed, who
came reeling up to the hospital, holding his hand
to his face, and when he took his hand down most
of his face came with it. Oh, yes, they were
retreating, those who had enough life left to
walk. And they told us that Verdun was
lost, that no human power could resist that
thrust.&#8221;</p>

<p>All that night, and all the next day and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the next night, such men poured through and
past the hospital and during all that time there
was no cessation in the intolerable, maddening
din of the artillery. When you ask Dr. Girard-Mangin
how she lived through those days and
nights, she tells you steadily, &#8220;Oh, that was not
the worst. We could still work. And we did.
More than eighteen thousand wounded passed
through the hospital that week. We had too
much to do to think of anything else. It seemed
as though all the men in the world were wounded
and pouring in on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, the tide of men
changed in character somewhat, and this meant
that the end was near. In place of <i>chasseurs</i>
and the ordinary <i>poilus</i>, quantities of brown
Moroccans, those who fight at the very front,
came fleeing back, horribly wounded, most of
them, yelling wild prayers to Allah, clutching at
themselves like children and howling like wild
beasts&mdash;impossible to understand or to make
understand. And yet, somehow, the hospital
staff, staggering with fatigue themselves, ministered
to them, too, until&mdash;this was where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
all touched bottom&mdash;until, on Wednesday night,
the electricity suddenly gave out and, in the
twinkling of an eye, blackness fell on the great
wards, shaken by the incessant infernal screaming
rush of the shells overhead, by the thunder
of the cannon, and filled with the shrieks of the
agonizing wild men from Africa. Blackness
like the end of the world.</p>

<p>Messengers were sent hastily to grope their
way down to the nearest village for candles.
But they returned empty-handed. Long before
that the soldiers had carried off all the supply
of candles.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do, all that night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Girard-Mangin makes no light pretense of
belittling the experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was awful beyond anything imaginable,&#8221;
she tells you gravely. &#8220;The worst thing that
can happen to a doctor had come&mdash;to be in the
midst of suffering and not to be able to lift a
finger to help. All that we could do was to give
them water to drink. We could feel our way to
the water-pitchers. The rest of the time we
could only sit, helpless, listen to the shells and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to the wounded men groaning, and wait for
dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, it is a small, delicately fashioned woman,
like you, like me, who lived through those days
and those nights, and came through them morally
and physically intact, into an even greater usefulness.
It will not be a bad thing to remember
her the next time we feel &#8220;tired&#8221; in our
ordinary round of small efforts.</p>

<p>On the next day came the order to evacuate
the hospital, bitter proof of the German success.
Dr. Girard-Mangin began sending off her sick
men in relays of four in the only ambulance at
her disposal. They were taken down to the
nearest little branch railroad, there put on the
train, and sent&mdash;nobody knew where, anywhere
out of the range of German guns.</p>

<p>All day Thursday the evacuation went on. By
Thursday evening there were left only nine men
in her ward, men practically dying, far gone
with intestinal hemorrhages, too ill to move.
Dr. Girard-Mangin spent another black night
beside her dying men, moving from one to
another in the intense obscurity, raising her voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
above the thunder of the artillery to comfort
them, to give them what small help she could
without a light. On Friday all the hospital
staff, with a few exceptions, was to leave. The
hospital buildings and equipment were to be left
in the charge of a non-com and two privates;
and the men too ill to transport were to be left
with one doctor and two aides. The rule in the
French Sanitary Service for that case is that
the youngest doctor stays with the sick. Dr.
Girard-Mangin was the youngest doctor.</p>

<p>But at this, the good head-doctor, who had
daughters of his own in Paris, cried out that
there was a limit, that he would never forgive
any man who left a daughter of his
alone in such a position, alone with dying men,
alone under fire, alone to face the <i>Boches</i>.
No, no Frenchman could be expected to do
that.</p>

<p>Dr. Girard-Mangin appealed over his head to
the military authority in command, for permission
to do her duty as it fell to her. &#8220;I have
not failed in my services so far. It is not just
to force me to fail now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>The military ruling was that the usual rule
would hold. The little woman doctor stayed in
danger, and the men went back to the rear. The
parting was a moving one; those comrades of
hers who had seen her working by their sides
for so many months took her in their arms and
wept openly as they bade her good-by.</p>

<p>If you venture to ask her what were her own
emotions at this moment, she tells you with a
shudder, &#8220;Oh, sorrow, black, black sorrow for
France. We all thought, you know, that Verdun
had fallen, that the Germans had pierced the line.
No one knew how far they had gone. It was
an awful moment.&#8221; Apparently she did not
think of herself at all.</p>

<p>All day Friday, she was there with her
stricken men and with two aides. Friday night
she lay beside them in the dark. On Saturday
the man left in charge of the hospital buildings
went mad from the nervous tension&mdash;they expected
almost from hour to hour to see the Germans
appear&mdash;and from the hellish noise of the
artillery.</p>

<p>I find myself cold as I try to think what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
another black night meant in those conditions.
Dr. Girard-Mangin passed it and emerged into
another dawn.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning the General in command
of that region, amazed to find that any one was
still there, sent peremptory orders that the
premises must be evacuated entirely, dying men
and all. They would certainly be killed if they
were kept there. And more, there was no
longer anything to give them to eat. This was
a military order and so overrode the rulings of
the Sanitary Service. Dr. Girard-Mangin prepared
to evacuate. She had at her disposition a
small <i>camion</i> in which she put the four men best
able to be carried, and her own ambulance in
which she packed the five worst cases, crosswise
of the vehicle. To try to give them some security
against the inevitable jolting, she bound them
tightly over and over to their stretchers. Then,
with her little medicine-kit, she got in beside
them and told her chauffeur to take them to
Clermont-en-Argonne, and not by the safer route
taken by the <i>ravitaillement</i> convoys, because her
sick men could never live through the length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that trip, but by the shorter road, leading along
directly back of the front.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder that he was willing to take that
dangerous route,&#8221; you say.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask his opinion about it,&#8221; says Dr.
Girard-Mangin with a ring of iron in her voice.</p>

<p>So began a wild ride of forty-three kilometers,
constantly under fire, with five men at the point
of death. The chauffeur dodged between the
bursting shells, the woman in the car watched
her sick men closely and kept them up with hypodermics
of stimulants&mdash;which are not administered
by a shaking hand!</p>

<p>You ask respectfully, looking at the white scar
on her cheek, &#8220;It was then, during that ride,
that you were wounded, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nods, hastily, indifferently, and says,
&#8220;And when we finally reached Clermont-en-Argonne,
my sick men were no better off, for I
found the hospital absolutely swamped with
wounded. I said I was there with five mortally
sick men from Verdun, and they answered, &#8216;If
they were all Generals we could not take them
in. You are mad, Madame, to bring <i>sick</i> men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
here.&#8217; So we went on ten kilometers further to
a little village called Froidos, where my face-wound
was dressed and where finally I was able
to leave my men, all alive still, in good hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t live to get well, did they?&#8221; you
ask.</p>

<p>At this question, she has a moment of stupefaction
before the picture of your total incomprehension
of what she has been talking about;
she has a moment&#8217;s retrospective stare back into
that seething caldron which was the battle of
Verdun; she opens her mouth to cry out on your
lack of imagination; and she ends by saying
quietly, almost with pity for your ignorance,
&#8220;Oh, I never saw or heard of those men again.
There was a great deal too much else to be done
at that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Have you lost track of time and place in that
adventure of hers? It is not surprising. She
was then in the little village of Froidos, on the
afternoon of Sunday, February 27th, almost
exactly a week after the battle began&mdash;and after
almost exactly a week of unbelievable horror&mdash;after
four nights spent without a light in a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
hospital full of wounded men&mdash;after a ride of
nearly fifty kilometers constantly under fire, with
mortally sick men. And she now turned, like a
good soldier who has accomplished the task set
him, to report at headquarters for another.</p>

<p>Her headquarters, the <i>Direction du Service
Sanitaire</i> was at Bar-le-Duc. Without a moment&#8217;s
rest or delay, she set out for Bar-le-Duc,
she and her chauffeur, half-blind with lack of
sleep. They arrived there at midnight. She
reported herself at the hospital, so large that in
normal times it holds three thousand wounded.
&#8220;I have just brought in the last of the sick from
the military hospital at Verdun,&#8221; she said, to
explain her presence. They were astounded to
hear that any one had been there so lately.
Every one had thought that certainly the Germans
were there by that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, is there a place where I may sleep a
few hours?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>But there was no place, not one. The great
hospital was crowded to the last inch of its
space with wounded&mdash;halls, passageways, aisles,
even the stairs had wounded on them. Finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
some one gave her a blanket and she lay down
on the floor in the little office of the head-doctor
and slept till morning&mdash;five or six hours. Then
she went out into the town to try to find a lodging.
Not one to be had, the town being as full
as the hospital. She had not taken her clothes
off, naturally, nor her shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then I did feel tired,&#8221; she says. &#8220;That
morning, for the first time, I knew how tired I
was, as I went dragging myself from door to
door, begging for a room and a bed. It was
because I was no longer working, you see. As
long as you have work to do, you can go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last a poor woman took pity on her, said
that she and her daughter would sleep together
on one narrow bed, and let her have the other
one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so glad, so glad,&#8221; says Dr. Girard-Mangin,
&#8220;to know I was to have a real bed! I
was like a child. When you are as tired as that,
you don&#8217;t think of anything but the simple elementals&mdash;lying
down, being warm, having something
to eat&mdash;all your fine, civilized ideas are
swept away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>She went back toward the hospital to get what
few things she had been able to bring with her,
and there she saw her chauffeur waving a paper
toward her. &#8220;We are to be off at once,&#8221; he said,
and showed her an order to leave Bar-le-Duc
without delay, taking two nurses with them, and
to go with all speed to the hospital at Vadelaincourt.
They were crowded with wounded there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, at once, my tiredness went away,&#8221; she
says. &#8220;It only lasted while I thought of getting
a bed. When I knew we were going into action
once more, I was myself again.&#8221;</p>

<p>By two o&#8217;clock that afternoon&mdash;this was Monday&mdash;they
were <i>en route</i> for the hospital, the
doctor on the seat by the chauffeur, the two
nurses, hysterical with fear over the shells,
weeping inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a terrible, tragic, inspiring trip that
was!&#8221; she exclaims, and almost for the only
time during her quietly told narration her voice
quivers, her eyes suffuse. &#8220;We were going
against the tide of fresh reserves, rushing out to
the front&mdash;mile after mile, facing those strongly
marching ranks of splendid young Frenchmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
all going out to suffer the unimaginable horrors
from which I had just come. I could not bear
to look into those eager, ardent faces. I was so
proud of them, so yearning over them! And
they were so full of spirit, hurrying forward to
the supreme sacrifice. They shouted out to us
again and again, &#8216;The battle isn&#8217;t over yet, is
it? Will we get there in time?&#8217; They laughed
light-heartedly, the younger ones, when they
saw me and called out, &#8216;Oh, the women are fighting
out there, too, are they?&#8217; Wave after wave
of them, rank on rank, the best of my country,
marching out to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were delayed by an accident to a tire,
being instantly&mdash;as is the rule on military roads,
always crammed to the last inch&mdash;lifted bodily
into a neighboring field for repairs. No stationing
for repairs is allowed on a road where
every one is incessantly in movement. While
the repairs were being made, the car sank deeper
and deeper into the mud, and it was a Herculean
undertaking to get it back in the main thoroughfare.
As usual, a crowd of good-natured <i>poilus</i>
managed this, heaving together with the hearty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
good-will to which all drivers of American ambulances
can testify.</p>

<p>Delayed by this, it was nearly midnight when
they drew near their destination. The chauffeur
turned off the main road into a smaller one, a
short cut to the hospital, and sank at once in
mud up to his hubs. From twelve o&#8217;clock that
night till half-past five in the morning, they
labored to make the few kilometers which
separated them from Vadelaincourt. Once the
chauffeur, hearing in the dark the rush of water
against the car, announced that he was sure that
the river had burst its banks, that they had
missed the bridge and were now in the main current.
Dr. Girard-Mangin got down to investigate
and found herself knee-deep in mud so
liquid that its sound had deceived the chauffeur.
They toiled on, the nurses inside the car wringing
their hands.</p>

<p>By the time it was faintly dawn they arrived
at the hospital, where the hard-worked head-doctor,
distracted with the rush of wounded,
cried out upon her for being a woman, but told
her for Heaven&#8217;s sake to stay and help. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
nurses were taken in and set to work, where at
once they forgot themselves and their fears.
But again there was no place for the new doctor
to sleep, the hospital being overflowing with
human wreckage. She did what all ambulance
people hate to do, she went back to the reeking
ambulance, laid herself on a stretcher, wet boots
and all, drew up about her the typhoid-soaked
blankets of her ex-patients, and instantly fell
asleep. The chauffeur had the preferable place
of sleeping under the car, on another stretcher.</p>

<p>She had no more than closed her eyes, when
came a loud, imperious pounding on the car,
&#8220;Get up quickly. The <i>médecin-en-chef</i> sends for
you at once; terrible lot of wounded just brought
in; every hand needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went back through the mud to the hospital,
had a cup of hot coffee and&mdash;detail eloquent of
the confusion and disorganization of that feverish
week&mdash;some plum-cake! By what freak of
<i>ravitaillement</i> there was only plum-cake, she
never knew.</p>

<p>Then she put on her operating-apron and cap.
She went into the operating-room at half-past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
seven in the morning. She operated steadily,
without stopping, for more than five hours. At
one o&#8217;clock she felt giddy and her legs failed her.
She sat down flat on the floor, leaning back
against the wall. &#8220;Here it comes!&#8221; she said to
herself, fighting the faintness which dissolved all
her members, &#8220;Here comes womanishness!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it did not come. She sat thus, setting her
teeth and tightening her will until she conquered
it. A new relay of doctors came in. She staggered
off, had more coffee, a piece of chocolate
and another piece of plum-cake! And was told
that she would be &#8220;off duty&#8221; till eight that
evening. Where could she go to rest? Nowhere.
Snow lay on the fields, mud was deep in the
roads. There was not a bed empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sat down in a corner, in a chair, quite a
comfortable chair,&#8221; she tells you, &#8220;and took
down my hair and brushed and braided it. You
know how much that rests you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, Dr. Girard-Mangin is the last person in
the world over whom to sentimentalize, and I
swore before beginning to write about her that
I would try not to do it. But I can not restrain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
myself from asking you here if you do not feel
with me like both laughing and crying at the
inimitable, homely femininity of that familiar
gesture, at the picture of that shining little warrior-figure,
returning in that abomination of
desolation to the simple action of a sheltered
woman&#8217;s everyday home life?</p>

<p>Then she went to sleep, there in the &#8220;quite
comfortable&#8221; chair, with her shoes unlaced but
still on her feet. &#8220;I had lost my other pair
somewhere along the route,&#8221; she explains, &#8220;and
I didn&#8217;t dare to take those off because I knew I
could never get them on again if I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed twenty days of this terrific
routine, steady work in the operating-room with
intervals of seven hours&#8217; &#8220;rest,&#8221; with nowhere
to go to rest. &#8220;But the food got better almost
at once,&#8221; she says, in explanation of her having
lived through it. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t have gotten
along on plum-cake, of course!&#8221;</p>

<p>For nine of those twenty days, she never took
off her shoes at all, and the foot was frozen
there which now she drags a little in walking.</p>

<p>On March 23rd, a month after the battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Verdun had begun, the <i>médecin-chef-inspecteur</i>
came to Vadelaincourt, went through the usual
motions of stupefaction to find a woman doctor
there, decided&mdash;rather late&mdash;that it was no place
for a woman, and sent her to Châlons. For six
months thereafter, she was in the Somme, near
Ypres, working specially among the tubercular
soldiers, but also taking her full share of military
surgery. &#8220;Just the usual service at the
front, nothing of special interest,&#8221; she says with
military brevity, baffling your interest, and leaving
you to find out from other sources that she
was wounded again in June of that year.</p>

<p>On the 11th of October, 1916, a remarkable
and noteworthy event took place. For once a
Governmental action was taken with intelligence.
The Government, wishing to institute a
special course of training for military nurses at
the front, called to its organization and direction,
not somebody&#8217;s relation-in-law, not a politician&#8217;s
protégée, but the woman in France best
fitted to undertake the work. Such an action on
the part of any Government is worthy of note!</p>

<p>The hospital which had been built for charitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
purposes on the Rue Desnouettes was loaned
to the Government. What was needed for its
head was some one who knew all about what
training was essential for nursing service at the
front. Any good military doctor could have
done this part. Also some one was needed who
knew all about what is the life of a woman at
the front. Any good nurse of military experience
could have seen to this. Also there was
needed a person with experience in organization,
with the capacity to keep a big enterprise in
smooth and regular running. Any good business
man could have managed this. Furthermore
there was needed a person with magnetism who
could inspire the women passing through the
school with enthusiasm, with ardor, with devotion&mdash; I
needn&#8217;t go on, I think. You must have
seen that only one person combined all these
qualifications, and she is the one now at the head
of the hospital-school.</p>

<p>Dr. Girard-Mangin received a call summoning
her back to that &#8220;work at the rear&#8221; which
is such a trial for those who have known the
glory of direct service at the front.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>This meant drudgery for her, long hours of
attention to uninteresting but important details,
work with a very mixed class of intelligences&mdash;the
women in her courses of study vary from
peasant girls to officers&#8217; widows; bending her
quick intelligence to cope with sloth and dullness.
It meant, worst of all and hardest of all,
living again in the midst of petty bickerings,
little personal jealousies, mean ambitions. Nothing
is more startling for those who &#8220;come back
from the front&#8221; than to find the world at the
rear still going on with its tiny quarrels and
disputes, still industriously raking in its muck-heap.
And nothing more eloquently paints our
average, ordinary life than the intense moral
depression which attends the return to it of those
who have for a time escaped from it to a
rougher, more dangerous, and more self-forgetful
atmosphere.</p>

<p>For me, no part of Dr. Girard-Mangin&#8217;s usefulness
is more dramatic than the undramatic
phase of it in which she is now faithfully toiling.
Her coolness under fire, her steadiness
under overwhelming responsibilities, her astonishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
physical endurance do not thrill me more
than this prompt, disciplined ability to take up
civilian life again and quiet, civilian duties.</p>

<p>She has organized the hospital ingeniously
along original lines, as a perfect reproduction
of what the nurses will encounter at the front:
a series of barracks, a ward to each shed, with
the nurse&#8217;s little sleeping-cubicle at the end with
its rough but sufficient sanitary arrangements.
Another unit is given over to the operating-room
and its appendages, the sterilizing-room,
anesthetic-room, etc. Another is the administrative
building, and contains the offices of the
<i>médecin-en-chef</i>, the head-nurse, the pharmacy,
the bacteriological laboratory. At one side are
very simple but wholesome sleeping quarters and
study-rooms for the fifty and more nurses who
pass through the school every three months. For
Dr. Girard-Mangin only takes them in hand
when they have already completed a course of
training in ordinary hospitals. Even then she
weeds out rigorously, in the middle of the short,
intensive, concentrated course, those who do not
show the necessary physical, mental, and moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
qualities to fit them for the grave responsibilities
they will have at the front, for nurses from
this hospital go out to direct and run the field
hospitals, not merely to be nurses there.</p>

<p>The work for the doctor at the head is a
&#8220;grind,&#8221; nothing less, monotonous, like all teaching&mdash;an
ever-reiterated repetition of the same
thing&mdash;no glory, no change, no bright face of
danger. The clear brown eyes face it as coolly,
as undaunted, as they faced bursting shells, or
maddened soldiers. The clear-thinking brain
sees its vital importance to the country as well
as it saw the more picturesque need for staying
with sick men under fire. The well-tempered
will keeps lassitude and fatigue at bay, keeps
the whole highly strung, highly developed organism
patiently, steadily, enduringly at work
for France.</p>

<p>There, my fellow-citizens in America, there is
a citizen to envy, to imitate!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>From the Ends of the Earth they come&mdash;Old
and Young, the Lame and the Blind&mdash;to Ask for
the Blessing.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Afternoon.</span> There was not a vacant place left
in the long line of waiting sick, so that at the
last, when a little, white-faced blind boy with
dreadful horny growths on his eyes, was handed
over the heads of the crowd, he seemed to have
come too late.</p>

<p>His mother&#8217;s voice rose anxiously, in reiterated
piteous demands to the stretcher-carriers to
make a place for him, any place, where he could
receive the blessing, for it was the day of the
greatest pilgrimage of the year, when twenty-five
thousand people sang and prayed together for
the cure of the sick, when the Host was carried
in solemn procession to bless them, lying in long
lines up and down the broad esplanade.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, for the love of God, find a place for
him!&#8221; she implored, in so strained a voice of
entreaty that the crowd, dense as it was, gave
way a little and allowed her to press forward,
back of the wheeled chairs of the cripples. The
stretcher-carrier who had taken the child in his
arms hesitated, looking about him for a vacant
spot. He glanced at a wounded soldier, rigid
on his litter, his face as white as it would be in
his coffin; and then turned to a child stricken
with a disease of the bones which paralyzed his
legs and made of his hands only twisted, shapeless
stumps, but which still permitted him to sit
in one of the wheeled chairs. His little withered
body did not half fill it, and it was there beside
him that the attendant decided to put down the
blind boy.</p>

<p>His mother gave a long sigh of intense feeling
and between the closely packed bodies of
the crowd strained forward to be near him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here, darling, I&#8217;m here,&#8221; she said in a
voice of concentrated tenderness.</p>

<p>The blind boy turned his hanging head a little,
toward the sound of her voice and stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
back a thin, waxy-white hand. She managed to
touch it for an instant, but then said, &#8220;Not now,
darling. You mustn&#8217;t turn back toward Mother.
You must join your hands and pray to be cured,
pray for the blessing. You must repeat whatever
the priest says.&#8221;</p>

<p>For at that moment the powerfully built,
bearded priest, with the eyes of fire and the
thrown-back head of born command, strode
down the center of the great open place and
stood looking intently about him at the lines of
the white-faced sick, and the immense throngs
of pilgrims back of them. He raised his hands
suddenly in a vivid gesture, and cried in a
trumpet-like voice, like a captain leading forward
a charge, &#8220;Brothers, pray! Pray for our
sick. With all your soul, with all the strength
of your body and mind, pray God for our
sick!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment. Every eye was on him.</p>

<p>The blind boy held his face lowered meekly
as blind children often do, as sensitive children
who know themselves unsightly always do. His
thin, white neck was bent like that of a victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
awaiting the blow, but he put his little pale
fingers together and, turning for a moment, tried
to show to his mother that they were in the attitude
of prayer. She whispered, &#8220;Yes, yes,
darling, that is right. But not toward me.
Toward where the blessing is coming, so that
you may be cured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord save us! Lord God save us, for we
perish!&#8221; prayed the priest in a loud clear voice
of exaltation; and after him all the multitude
cried it aloud, in a great murmur like the voice
of a forest, or of the sea.</p>

<p>The blind boy&#8217;s lips moved with the rest, but
his little face was clouded and anxious. He
whispered to the crippled child beside him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you blind, too, or can you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;but I have never
walked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must show me where I must put
my hands so that they will be toward the blessing,&#8221;
begged the blind child.</p>

<p>The other took the thin, transparent fingers
between his twisted stumps, and directed them
toward the priest, thrillingly upright, aspiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
visibly toward the sky. &#8220;There, you must keep
them turned toward the priest now,&#8221; he said with
an accent of certainty. &#8220;Later on it will be
toward the procession as it moves along, and
then at the last toward the church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must tell me when to change them,&#8221;
said the blind boy.</p>

<p>He stretched out his joined hands farther in
the direction indicated by his companion and
repeated with the others, after the priest, his
little voice lost in the great upward rush of
the supplications of the thousands around
him, &#8220;Lord! Lord! Our sole trust is in
Thee!&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest&#8217;s voice soared into a glorious note
of song, in which the multitude joined, their
eyes on him, their faces solemn in expectation.
The priest sang a line, the multitude chanted a
response; the man&#8217;s voice ran out again, yearning,
beseeching, the voice of the multitude rose
thousand-fold in answer. The earth seemed to
shake in unison, the low-hanging, heavy gray
clouds to send back the sound. The chanting,
imploring, impassioned voice of the throng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
seemed more alive than its multitudinous bodies,
rapt into utter stillness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it thus that I should hold my hands?&#8221;
whispered the blind boy after a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, now the procession has just come into
the other end of the square,&#8221; said the crippled
child. With an effort he leaned, took the little
white fingers again, and pointed them another
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;So?&#8221; asked the blind child humbly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, so,&#8221; answered the other. He tried to
put his own shapeless stumps together in the attitude
of prayer and began to sing with the pilgrims
now defiling before them in endless lines,
&#8220;Praise! All praise to Thee! Praise, all praise
to Thee, Lord God!&#8221; The pilgrims were passing
by, now, in single file, each with his long
white taper, burning yellow in the gray light of
the gray day. Their voices were loud and personal,
each one as he passed being heard for an
instant alone. &#8220;Glory! Glory to Thee!&#8221; they
all sang the propitiatory words together, over
and over, a hundred times repeated&mdash;the old
wrinkled peasants in their blouses; the elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
officers in their well-cut uniforms; the stout
elderly merchants; the thin, weedy boys; the
white-faced, shaven priests; the black men from
Senegal with bushy, woolly hair; the tall, fair-haired
man from England; the occasional soldier
on leave in his shapeless, faded, blue-gray
uniform. Above all their voices rose the silver
bugle-like call of the priest, burning, devouring
in its ardor, &#8220;Brothers! Brothers! with all your
souls, now. GLORY BE TO THEE! Oh,
Lord, save us, for we perish! Lord, our trust
is in Thee. Praised be Thy name!&#8221;</p>

<p>With each clamorous exhortation, repeated
clamorously by all those imploring voices, he
lifted the multitude up another step toward the
great moment of awe and faith. The tears
were streaming down the faces of many of the
women in the crowd. The little boy&#8217;s mother
sobbed loudly, and prayed with all her might.</p>

<p>The march past of the innumerable men, the
incessant flickering passage of their pale-yellow
lights, the never-ending procession of their pale,
anxious faces, became an obsession. It seemed
that every one, everywhere in the world, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
marching together, singing and praying, hoping
against hope for a miracle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it time to change my hands?&#8221; asked
the little blind boy desperately. &#8220;I have
heard so <i>many</i> people pass. I am very, very
tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is not yet time to change,&#8221; said
the other, leaning forward to look down the
esplanade. &#8220;The procession with the Host goes
very slowly because it stops before each sick person.
They are not near yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My hands are very tired,&#8221; murmured the
little blind boy, faintly. But he held his hands
out still, praying with the others, as the priest
directed them. &#8220;Lord help us, for we perish.
Lord! Thou alone canst save us! Lord, say but
one word and we are healed. Lord, say but
one word. But one word, oh, Lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>He held his strengthless hands out as he was
told, groping helplessly for the blessing he so
sorely needed; his blind eyes turned docilely in
the direction indicated to him; he repeated
meekly in his feeble little voice whatever words
he was told to say&mdash;and all around him thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and thousands of other helpless, docile,
suffering human beings in similar plight, did the
same, desperately, their faces groping up toward
the sky, their joined hands imploring, &#8220;Lord
save us, or we perish!&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilgrims filed past continually, their eyes
staringly fixed on the feeble light of their tapers,
their voices torn out of their bodies by the ever-deepening
fervor and hope of the shouted,
passionate commands of the priest, calling,
&#8220;Brothers! With all your soul pray for our
sick! Lord, say but one word and they are
healed! But one word, oh, Lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The blessing is very long in coming,&#8221; faltered
the blind boy timidly, his face even whiter
than at the beginning, his lips blue.</p>

<p>The pilgrims passed constantly, the heavy
tramp of their feet shaking the chair on which
sat the little paralyzed boy and the blind child,
their hands outstretched. The men&#8217;s voices were
hoarse and deep now, trembling with fatigue
and emotion.</p>

<p>The perspiration streamed down the face of
the priest as in piercing tones he exhorted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
multitudes, &#8220;Brothers, with all your soul, pray!
<i>Pray!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently, because he was a weak, sick little
child, and because the blessing was so long in
coming, the little blind boy fell asleep, his head
on the shoulder of the paralyzed child.</p>

<p>Then all the care and anxiety and humiliation
and sorrow left his little white face. It was perfect
in a perfect peace.</p>

<p>The blessing had come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Evening.</i></p>

<p>Scattered all over the vast stretch of the
esplanade, thousands of little lights flickered and
moved about in the rainy darkness, all that could
be seen of the immense multitude gathering for
the evening procession. The top of the great,
horseshoe-shaped, marble, inclined plane up
which they were later to defile, was so high
above the ground that not a sound reached there
of all those human voices talking together in the
dark, calling to each other, as people tried to find
their friends in the obscurity, and to form
groups that they might march together. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
little lights they held were only slightly sheltered
from the gusts of wind-driven rain by cheap
paper shades and they flickered and flared up,
and many were extinguished. Although many
went out and were lighted again only once more
to have the wind puff them into blackness, the
number of lighted ones grew fabulously as the
crowd assembled. The little yellow spots of life
spread further and further, till around the foot
of the huge inclined plane was an ocean of lights,
heaving formlessly, with a futile, aimless motion
like the sea, humanity lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Then a faint murmur came up through the
rain and darkness. Speaking voices are not
heard far, but voices raised in song have wings.
The crowd was beginning to sing.</p>

<p>It was also beginning to take shape. From
the foot of the inclined plane out into the black
esplanade, streamed two long files of light, purposeful,
with the sharp, forward-piercing line of
the arrow. The procession was beginning to
form.</p>

<p>The murmur rose into a chant as the crowd,
hearing the first notes, took it up, singing as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
fell into line. The first of the lights advanced
up the ascent toward the top, which was blazing
with light from the illuminated front of the lofty
church. Far, far behind, stretching twice
around the immense esplanade and disappearing
into the distant blackness of the endless avenue,
the flickering lights were now in two lines, moving
forward steadily.</p>

<p>The sound of voices grew louder, the advancing
files were visible now, masses intensely black
against the night.</p>

<p>The wind roared, the rain beat down. The
voices suddenly rang out clear and vibrant, high
above the confused roar of the singing multitudes
below.</p>

<p>Then the glimmering blur of the faces in the
reflected light of the candles shone through the
rain; each dim figure, in a momentary transfiguration,
was resplendent in the flare of light
from the church, the voices shouted loud and
strong, drowning out in their instant&#8217;s glory of
individual life the hoarse chant of the vast crowd
below. Then each figure passed forward out of
the light and began to descend the inclined plane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
on the other side, going singing down into the
blackness.</p>

<p>There were so many singing now that, although
they all sang the same chant over and
over, a chant in which recurs constantly the
acclaiming shout of &#8220;Hail! Hail!&#8221; they were
not singing in tune together nor even in time,
nor even often the same words at the same time.</p>

<p>As the groups passed, each one was singing in
its own fashion on a different key from those
gone before and those following them. When
this was too apparent, they sometimes stopped,
listened, caught the note from the pilgrims nearest
to them, and burst out again, this time in
harmony. But for the most part they listened
only to their own voices and to those of their
friends, and sang lustily in a hearty discordance.&mdash;and
so vast was the throng and so simple
the joyful air they chanted, that from that
monstrous discordance rose a strange and wonderful
harmony like no other music in the world,
with a deep pulsation longer than that of any
other music, beating time, beating true.</p>

<p>They passed, shouting out loudly the confident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
words of their song; the young faces often
laughing gaily in the shaking light of their
candles, stopping to light the blown-out flames at
the candles of their friends; the older people
tramping forward resolutely, singing, often not
noting that their one light had been blown out
and that they were walking in darkness&mdash;no, not
walking in darkness, because of the infinite number
of lights about them, carried by their fellows;
the young girls&#8217; eyes glistening through
the rain as they gazed upward toward the circle
of white light at the top of the ascent; the old
men&#8217;s eyes turned downward on the darkness to
which they would descend; the occasional priest-leader
beating time, marshaling the lines; the
occasional children holding to their parents&#8217;
hands, their eyes blank and trustful, fixed on
their candles, their pure lips incessantly shaping
the joyful acclaiming shout of &#8220;Hail! Hail!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes a group lagged behind, either because
of the carelessness of the young people
in it, or the fatigue of the old people, and there
was almost a break in the line of lights. But
always as they approached the moment of transfiguration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the ones who were behind hurried
forward shufflingly to keep the line intact. The
line was always intact.</p>

<p>The rain beat down on them, but they sang
loudly and joyously, rejoicing in singing together;
the wind tore at their garments and
puffed at their frail, unprotected lights. Many
went out. But there were always enough lights
left in each group to light those of the others&mdash;if
they wished.</p>

<p>Last of all I saw a strong young man whose
light had been extinguished, holding out his lifeless
candle to that of an old, poor, bent woman
who, patiently, patiently, offered him her tiny,
living flame.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SOME CONFUSED IMPRESSIONS</h2></div>

<p class="center">(<i>Near Château-Thierry, July, 1918</i>)</p>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were detraining in dense brown crowds at
what had been the station before German guns
had knocked it into a shapeless heap of tumbled
bricks; they were pouring in on foot along the
road from the west; and when I made my way
along the main street to the river, I found another
khaki-clad line leaving the little town,
marching heavily, unrhythmically and strongly
out across the narrow, temporary wooden
bridge, laid hastily across the massive stone
pillars which were all that remained of the
old bridge.</p>

<p>An old, white-capped woman, who had been
one of my neighbors in the days before the little
town had known German guns or American
soldiers, called out to me: &#8220;Oh, Madame! See
them! Isn&#8217;t it wonderful! Just look at them!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
All day like that, all night like that. Are there
any people left in America? And are all your
people so big, so fine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they going?&#8221; I asked her, taking
refuge for a moment in her doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the front directly, the poor boys. They&#8217;ll
be fighting in two hours&mdash;do you hear the big
guns off there banging away? And they so good,
like nice big boys! Their poor mothers!&#8221;</p>

<p>I addressed myself in English to a soldier loitering
near, watching the troops pass, &#8220;So they
are going to the front, these boys?&#8221; After a
stare of intense surprise, a broad smile broke over
his face. He came closer. &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he
said, looking at me hard. &#8220;No, these are the
Alabama boys just coming back from the front.
They&#8217;ve been fighting steady for five days.&#8221; He
added: &#8220;My, it seems good to talk to an American
woman. I haven&#8217;t seen one for four
months!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just from the Champagne front, with the
Third Division. Two of our regiments out
there were&mdash;&#8221; He began pouring out exact, detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
military information which I would not
have dreamed of asking him. The simple-hearted
open confidence of the American soldier was
startling and alarming to one who had for long
breathed the thick air of universal suspicion. I
stopped his fluent statement of which was his
regiment, where they had been, what their losses
had been, where they were going. &#8220;No, no, I
mean where are you from in the States?&#8221; I
raised my voice to make myself heard above the
sudden thunder of a convoy of munition-camions
passing by and filling the narrow street from side
to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, from Kansas City, Missouri. It&#8217;s just
eight months and seven days since I last saw the
old town.&#8221; (Thus does a mother count the very
days of the little new life of her child.)</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you like France?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right, I guess. The climate&#8217;s not
so bad. And the towns would be well enough if
they&#8217;d clean up their manure-piles better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the people, how do you get on with
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The camions had passed and the street was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
again filled with American infantry, trudging forward
with an air of resolute endurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well enough, they don&#8217;t cheat you. I forgot
and left a fifty-franc bill lying on the table of a
house where I&#8217;d bought some eggs, and the next
morning the woman sent her little girl over to
camp to give it back. Real poor-appearing folk
they were, too. But I&#8217;ve had enough. I want
to get home. Uncle Sam&#8217;s good enough for me.
I want to hurry up and win the war and beat it
back to God&#8217;s country.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell away before the sudden assault on me
of an old, old man and his old wife, with the
dirt, the hunted look, the crumpled clothes, the
desperate eyes of refugees: &#8220;Madame, Madame,
help us! We cannot make them understand, the
Americans! We want to go back to Villers-le-Petit.
We want to see what is left of our house
and garden. We want to start in to repair the
house&mdash;and our potatoes must be dug.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had passed that morning through what was
left of their village. For a moment I saw their
old, tired, anxious faces dimly as though across
the long stretch of shattered heaps of masonry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I answered evasively, &#8220;But you know they are
not allowing civilian population to go back as
yet. All this region is still shelled. It&#8217;s far too
dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>They gave together an exclamation of impatience
as though over the futilities of children&#8217;s
talk. &#8220;But, Madame, if <i>we</i> do not care about
the danger. We never cared! We would not
have left, ever, if the soldiers had not taken us
away in camions&mdash;our garden and vineyard just
at the time when they needed attention every
hour. Well, we will not wait for permission;
we will go back anyhow. The American soldiers
are not bad, are they, Madame? They
would surely not fire on an old man and his
wife going back to their homes? If Madame
would only write on a piece of paper that we
only want to go back to our home to take care
of it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Their quavering old voices came to me indistinctly
through the steady thudding advance of
all those feet, come from so far, on so great,
so high, so perilous a mission; come so far, many
of them, to meet death more than half-way&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
poor, old, cramped people before me, blind
and deaf to the immensity of the earthquake,
seeing nothing but that the comfort of their own
lives was in danger. I had a nervous revulsion
of feeling and broke the news to them more
abruptly than I would have thought possible a
moment before. &#8220;There is nothing left to Villers-de-Petit.
There is nothing left to go back
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, they were not so cramped, so blind, so
small, my poor old people. They took the news
standing, and after the first clutch at each other&#8217;s
wrinkled hands, after the first paling of their
already ashy faces, they did not flinch.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the crops, Madame. The vineyards. Are
they all gone, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, very little damage done there. Everything
was kept, of course, intact for camouflage,
and the retreat was so rapid there was not enough
time for destruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we will still go back, Madame. We
have brought the things for spraying the vineyards
as far as here. Surely we can get them
to Villers-de-Petit, it is so near now. We can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sleep on the ground, anywhere. In another week,
you see, Madame, it will be too late to spray.
We have enough for ours and our neighbors,
too. We can save them if we go <i>now</i>. If Madame
would only write on a piece of paper in
their language that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>So I did it. I tore a fly-leaf out of a book
lying in the heap of rubbish before the ruins of
a bombarded house (it was a treatise on Bach&#8217;s
chorales by the French organist Widor!) and
wrote, &#8220;These are two brave old people, inhabitants
of Villers-de-Petit, who wish to go back
there to work under shell-fire to save what they
can of their own and their neighbors&#8217; crops.
Theirs is the spirit that is keeping France alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It probably won&#8217;t do you a bit of good,&#8221; I
said, &#8220;but there it is for what it is worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, once the American soldiers know what
we want, they will let us pass, we know.&#8221; They
went off trustfully, holding my foolish &#8220;pass&#8221;
in their hands.</p>

<p>I turned from them to find another young
American soldier standing near me. &#8220;How do
you do?&#8221; I said, smiling at him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>He gave a great start of amazement at the
sound of my American accent. &#8220;Well, how do
you like being in France?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! Are you really an American woman?&#8221;
he said incredulously, his young face lighting up
as though he saw a member of his own family.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t talked to one in so <i>long</i>! Why yes,
I like France fine. It&#8217;s the loveliest country to
look at, isn&#8217;t it? I didn&#8217;t know any country could
be kept up so, like a garden. How do they <i>do</i>
it without any men left? They must be awfully
fine people. I wish I could talk to them some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are these soldiers going through to-day?&#8221;
I asked. &#8220;Are they going out to the
front line trenches, or coming back? I&#8217;ve been
told both things.&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered with perfect certainty and precision:
&#8220;Neither. They are Second Division
troops, from Ohio mostly, just out of their
French training-camp, going up to hold the reserve
line. They never have been in action yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our attention was distracted to the inside of
a fruit-shop across the street, a group of American
soldiers struggling with the sign-language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a flushed, tired, distracted woman shopkeeper
volubly unable to conceive that men with all their
senses could not understand her native tongue.
I went across to interpret. One of the soldiers
in a strong Southern accent said, &#8220;Oh golly,
yes, if you <i>would</i> do the talkin&#8217; fo&#8217; us. We
cyan&#8217;t make out whetheh we&#8217;ve paid heh or not,
and we wondeh if she&#8217;d &#8217;low us to sit heah and
eat ouh fruit.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the Frenchwoman, &#8220;Oh, Madame, please
what <i>is</i> it they want now? I have shown them
everything in sight. How strange that they can&#8217;t
understand the simplest language!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little misunderstanding was soon cleared
away. I lingered by the counter. &#8220;How do you
like our American troops, Madame?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Very well, very much indeed, if only they could
talk. They don&#8217;t do any harm. They are good
to the children. They are certainly as brave as
men can be. But there is one thing about them
I don&#8217;t understand. They overpay you, often,
more than you ask&mdash;won&#8217;t take change&mdash;and yet
if you leave things open, as we always do, in
front of the shop, they just put their hands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and steal as they go by. I have lost a great deal
in that way. If they have so much money, why
do they steal?&#8221;</p>

<p>I contemplated making, and gave it up as too
difficult, a short disquisition on the peculiarities
of the American orchard-robbing tradition with
its ramifications, and instead sat down at the
table with the Americans, who gave me the greeting
always repeated, &#8220;Great Scott! its good to
talk to an American woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>A fresh-faced, splendidly built lad, looked up
from the first bite of his melon, crying: &#8220;Yes
suh, a cantaloupe, a&#8217; honest-to-the-Lawd cantaloupe!
I neveh thought they&#8217;d <i>heahd</i> of such a
thing in France.&#8221;</p>

<p>They explained to me, all talking at once,
pouring out unasked military information till my
hair rose up scandalized, that this was their first
experience with semi-normal civilian life in France
because they belonged to the troops from Georgia,
volunteers, that they had been in the front-line
trenches at exactly such a place for precisely
so many weeks where such and such things happened,
and before that at such another place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
where they were so many strong, etc., etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we neveh saw real sto&#8217;s to buy things till
we struck this town. And when I saw a cantaloupe
I mighty nigh dropped daid! I don&#8217;t reckon
I&#8217;m likely to run into a watermelon, am I?
I suahly would have to be ca&#8217;ied back to camp
on a stretcheh if I did!&#8221; He laughed out, a boy&#8217;s
cloudless laughter. &#8220;But say, what do you-all
think? I paid fo&#8217;ty-five cents for this slice, yes,
ma&#8217;am, fo&#8217;ty-five cents for a <i>slice</i>, and back home
in Geo&#8217;gia you pay a nickel for the biggest one
in the sto&#8217;!&#8221; He buried his face in the yellow
fruit.</p>

<p>The house began to shake to the ponderous
passage of artillery. The boys in khaki turned
their stag-like heads toward the street, glanced
at the motley-colored, mule-drawn guns and pronounced
expertly, &#8220;The 43rd, Heavy Artillery,
going out to Nolepieds, the fellows from Illinois.
They&#8217;ve just been up in the Verdun sector
and are coming down to reinforce the 102nd.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time the idea crossed my head
that possibly their mania for pouring out military
information to the first comer might not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
so fatal to necessary secrecy as it seemed. I
rather pitied the spy who might attempt to make
coherent profit out of their candor. &#8220;How do
you like being in France?&#8221; I asked the boy who
was devouring the melon.</p>

<p>He looked up, his eyes kindling, &#8220;Well, I was
plumb crazy to get heah and now I&#8217;m heah I
like it mo&#8217; even than I &#8217;lowed I would.&#8221; I looked
at his fresh, unlined boy&#8217;s cheeks, his clear, bright
boy&#8217;s eyes, and felt a great wave of pity. &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t been in active service yet,&#8221; I surmised.</p>

<p>Unconsciously, gayly, he flung my pity back in
my face, &#8220;You bet yo&#8217; life I have. We&#8217;ve just
come from the Champagne front, and the sehvice
we saw theah was suah active, how about it,
boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>They all burst out again in rapid, high-keyed,
excited voices, longing above everything else for
a listener, leaning forward over the table toward
me, their healthy faces flushed with their ardor,
talking hurriedly because there was so much to
say, their tense young voices a staccato clatter of
words which brought to me in jerks, horribly
familiar war-pictures, barrage-fires meeting, advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
over dead comrades, hideous hand-to-hand
combats&mdash;all chanted in those eager young
voices.</p>

<p>I felt the heavy pain at the back of the head
which presages a wave of mortal war-sickness.</p>

<p>In a pause, I asked, perhaps rather faintly,
&#8220;And you like it? You are not ever homesick?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy with the melon spoke for them all.
He stretched out his long arms, his hands clenched
to knotty masses of muscles; he set his jaw,
his blue eyes were like steel, his beautiful young
face was all aflame. &#8220;Oh, you just get to <i>love</i>
it!&#8221; he cried, shaking with the intensity of his
feeling. &#8220;You just <i>love</i> it! Why, I <i>neveh</i> want
to go home! I want to stay over heah and go
right on killin&#8217; <i>Boches</i> all my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this I felt sicker, stricken with the collective
remorse over the war which belongs to
the older generation. I said good-by to them
and left them to their child-like ecstasy over their
peaches and melons.</p>

<p>The artillery had passed. The street was again
solidly filled with dusty, heavily laden young
men in khaki, tramping silently and resolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
forward, their brown steel casques, shaped like
antique Greek shepherd hats, giving to their
rounded young faces a curious air of classic
rusticity.</p>

<p>An older man, with a stern, rough, plain face
stood near me. &#8220;How do you do?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Can you tell me which troops these are and
where they are going?&#8221; I wondered what confident
and uninformed answer I would receive
this time.</p>

<p>Showing no surprise at my speech, he answered,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who they be. You don&#8217;t never
know anything but your own regiment. The
kids always think they do. They&#8217;ll tell you this
and they&#8217;ll tell you that, but the truth is we don&#8217;t
know no more than Ann&mdash;not even where we are
ourselves, nor where we&#8217;re going, most of the
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>His accent made me say: &#8220;I wonder if you
are not from my part of the country. I live
in Vermont, when I&#8217;m at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from Maine,&#8221; he said soberly, &#8220;a farmer,
over draft age of course. But it looked to me
like a kind o&#8217; mean trick to make the boys do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
all for us, so I come along, too.&#8221; He added,
as if in partial explanation, &#8220;One of my uncles
was with John Brown at Harper&#8217;s Ferry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like it, now you&#8217;re here?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me heavily. &#8220;Like it? It&#8217;s
hell!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been in active service?&#8221; I used
my usual cowardly evasive phrase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;ve killed some of &#8217;em,&#8221; he
answered me with brutal, courageous directness.
He looked down at his hands as he spoke, big,
calloused farmer&#8217;s hands, crooked by holding the
plough-handles. As plainly as he saw it there,
I saw the blood on them, too. His stern, dark,
middle-aged face glowered down solemnly on
those strong farmer&#8217;s hands. &#8220;It&#8217;s dirty work,
but it&#8217;s got to be done,&#8221; he said, gravely, &#8220;and
I ain&#8217;t a-going to dodge my share of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very dark-eyed, gracefully-built young soldier
came loitering by now, and stopped near
us, ostensibly to look at the passing troops, but
evidently in order to share in the phenomenon
of a talk in English with an American woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I took him into the conversation with the usual
query, &#8220;How do you do, and how do you like
being in France?&#8221;</p>

<p>He answered with a strong Italian accent, and
I dived into a dusty mental corner to bring out
my half-forgotten Italian. In a moment we were
talking like old friends. He had been born in
Italy, yes, but brought up in Waterbury, Connecticut.
His grandfather had been one of Garibaldi&#8217;s
Thousand, so of course he had joined the
American army and come to France among the
first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there are more than a Thousand of
you this time,&#8221; I said, looking at the endless
procession defiling before us.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Si, signora</i>, but it is a part of the same war.
We are here to go on with what the Thousand
began.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, that was true, John Brown&#8217;s soul and
Garibaldi&#8217;s, and those of how many other fierce
old fighting lovers of freedom were marching on
there before my eyes, carried like invisible banners
by all those strong young arms.</p>

<p>An elderly woman in well-brushed dowdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
black came down the street toward us, an expression
of care on her face. When she saw me
she said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve found you. They said
you were in town to-day. Won&#8217;t you come back
to the house with me? Something important. I&#8217;m
terribly troubled with some American officers&mdash;oh,
the war!&#8221;</p>

<p>I went, apprehensive of trouble, and found her
house (save for a total absence of window-glass)
in its customary speckless and shining order. She
took me upstairs to what had been a bedroom
and was now an office in the Quartermaster&#8217;s
department. It was filled with packing-case improvised
desks and with serious-faced, youngish
American officers who, in their astonishment at
seeing me, forgot to take their long black cigars
out of their mouths.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said the woman-with-a-grievance,
pointing to the floor. &#8220;Just look at that. Just
<i>look</i>! I tell them and I <i>tell</i> them, not to put their
horrid boxes on the floor but to keep them on
the linoleum, but they are so stupid, they can&#8217;t
understand language that any child could take
in! And they drag those boxes just full of nails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
all over the floor. I&#8217;m <i>sick</i> of them and their
scratches!&#8221;</p>

<p>A big gun boomed solemnly off on the horizon
as accompaniment to this speech.</p>

<p>I explained in a neutral tone to the officers
looking expectantly at me, what was at issue.
I made no comment. None was needed evidently,
for they said with a gravity which I found lovable
that they would endeavor to be more careful
about the floor, that indeed they had not understood
what their landlady had been trying to tell
them. I gave her their assurance and she went
away satisfied.</p>

<p>As the door closed on her, they broke into
broad grins and pungent exclamations. &#8220;Well,
how about that! Wouldn&#8217;t that get you? With
the town bombarded every night, to think the old
lady was working herself up to a froth about her
floor-varnish! And we thinking that every
French person is breaking his heart over the
invaded regions!&#8221;</p>

<p>One of them said, &#8220;I never thought of it before,
but I bet you my Aunt Selina would do
just that! I just bet if her town was bombarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
she&#8217;d go right on shooing the flies out of her
kitchen and mopping up her pantry floor with
skim-milk. Why, the French are just like anybody,
aren&#8217;t they? Just like our own folks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; I assured him, &#8220;so exactly like
our own folks, like everybody&#8217;s own folks that
it&#8217;s quite impossible to tell the difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I went away, the owner of the house
was sweeping the garden-path clear of broken-glass.
&#8220;This bombardment is such a nuisance!&#8221;
she said disapprovingly. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what
the place would be like if I didn&#8217;t stay to look
after it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at her enviously, securely shut away
as she was by the rigid littleness of her outlook
from any blighting comprehension of what was
going on about her. But then, I reflected, there
are instants when the comprehension of what is
going on is not blighting. No, on the whole I
did not envy her.</p>

<p>Outside the gate I fell in at once with a group
of American soldiers. It was impossible to take
a step in any direction in the town without doing
this. After the invariable expressions of surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and pleasure over seeing an American woman,
came the invariable burst of eager narration of
where they had been and what had been happening
to them. They seemed to me touchingly
like children, who have had an absorbing, exciting
adventure and must tumble it all out to the first
person they meet. Their haste, their speaking all
at once, gave me only an incoherent idea of what
they wished to say. I caught odd phrases, disconnected
sentences, glimpses through pin-holes.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the fellows, a conscript, that came
to fill a vacant place in our lines, he was only
over in France two weeks, and it was his first
time in a trench. He landed there at six o&#8217;clock
in the evening, and just like I&#8217;m telling you, at
a quarter past six a shell up and exploded and
buried him right where he stood. Yes, ma&#8217;am,
you certainly do see some very peculiar things
in this war.&#8221;</p>

<p>From another, &#8220;We took the whole lot of &#8217;em
prisoners, and passed &#8217;em back to the rear, but
out of the fifteen we took, eight died of sudden
heart-disease before they got back to the
prisoners&#8217; camp.&#8221; (I tried not to believe this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
but the fact that it was told with a laugh and
received with a laugh reminded me gruesomely
that we are the nation that permits lynching of
helpless men by the mob.)</p>

<p>From another, &#8220;Some of the fellows say they
think about the <i>Lusitania</i> when they go after the
<i>Boche</i>. I don&#8217;t have to come down as far as
that. Belgium&#8217;s plenty good enough a whetstone
for <i>my</i> bayonet.&#8221; (This reminded me with
a thrill that we are the nation that has always
ultimately risen in defense of the defenseless.)</p>

<p>From another, &#8220;One of our own darkies went
up to one of these here Senegalese and began
talking United States to him. Of course the
other darkey talked back in French, and ours
said, &#8216;Why, you pore thing! You be&#8217;n over
heah so long you dun forgot yo&#8217; motheh-tongue!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>From another, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t stand the French!
They make me tired! And their jabber! I seen
some of &#8217;em talk it so fast they couldn&#8217;t even
understand each other! Honest, I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>From another, &#8220;There&#8217;s something that sort
of <i>takes</i> me about the life over here. I&#8217;m not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
going to be in any hurry to go back to the States
and hustle my head off, after the war&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

<p>From another, &#8220;Not for mine. Me for Chicago
the day after the <i>Boches</i> are licked.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were swept away by a counter-current
somewhere in the khaki ebb and flow about us,
and I found myself with a start next to a <i>poilu</i>,
yes a real <i>poilu</i> with a faded horizon-blue uniform
and a domed, battered, blue French casque,
such a <i>poilu</i> as had filled the town when I had
lived there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said to him, &#8220;things have changed
here. The town&#8217;s khaki now.&#8221; He looked at
me out of bright brown eyes, smiled, and entered
into conversation. We talked, of course, of the
American soldier, one of whom came up and
stood at my elbow. When I stopped to speak
to him, &#8220;Gee!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wish I could rip
it off like that. I can say &#8216;combien&#8217; and &#8216;trop
cher,&#8217; but there I stick. Say, what does the
Frenchman say about us? Now, since that little
Belleau-wood business I guess they see we know
a thing or two ourselves about how to run a
war! They&#8217;re all right, of course; mighty fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
soldiers, but Lord! you&#8217;d know by the way any
one of them does business, as if he&#8217;s all day for
it, that they couldn&#8217;t run a war <i>fast</i>, the way it
ought to be run, the way we&#8217;re going to run it,
now we&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not think it necessary to translate all of
this to the bright-eyed little Frenchman on my
other side, who began to talk as the American
stopped. &#8220;You asked my opinion of the American
troops, Madame. I will give it to you frankly.
The first who came over, your regular army, the
mercenaries, made a very bad impression indeed.
All who have come since have made the best
possible impression. They are really astonishingly
courageous, and there could be no better, or more
cordial comrades in the world. But oh! Madame,
as far as they really know how to make modern
war, they are children, just children! They make
the mistakes we made four years ago. They have
so much to learn of the technique of war, and
they will lose so many men in learning it! It is
sad to think of!&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not think it necessary to translate all this
to the American who now shook hands with both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of us and turned away. The Frenchman, too,
after a look at the clock in the church-tower,
made his compliments, saluted, and disappeared.</p>

<p>I walked forward and, coming to the church
door, stepped inside. It was as though I had
stepped into another world. I had found the only
place in town where there were no soldiers. The
great, gray, dim, vaulted interior was empty.</p>

<p>After the beat of the marching feet outside,
after the shuffling to and fro of the innumerable
men quartered in town, after the noisy shops
crowded with khaki uniforms, after the incessant
thunderous passage of the artillery and munitions-camions&mdash;the
long, hushed quiet of the empty
church rang loud in my ears. I wondered for
just an instant if there could be any military regulation,
forbidding our soldiers to enter the
church; and even as I wondered, the door opened
and a boy in khaki stepped in&mdash;one out of all
those hordes. He crossed himself, took a rosary
out of his pocket, knelt, and began his prayers.</p>

<p>Thirty-thousand soldiers were in that town that
day. Whatever else we are, I reflected, we are
not a people of mystics.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>But then I remembered the American soldier
who had said that Belgium was a good enough
whetstone for his bayonet. I remembered the
rough, gloomy farmer who did not want to shirk
his share of the world&#8217;s dirty work. Perhaps
there are various kinds of mystics.</p>

<p>Once outside the church I turned to look up
Madame Larconneur, the valiant market-gardener
who had been one of my neighbors, a tired young
war-widow, with two little children, whom I had
watched toiling early and late, day and night,
to keep intact the little property left her by her
dead soldier husband. I had watched her, drawing
from the soil of her big garden, wet quite
literally by her sweat, the livelihood for her
fatherless little girls. I wondered what the bombardment
of the town had done to her and her
small, priceless home.</p>

<p>I found the street, I found the other houses
there, but where her little, painfully, well-kept
house had stood was a heap of stones and rubble,
and in the place of her long, carefully tended
rows of beans and cabbages and potatoes, were
shell-holes where the chalky barren subsoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
streaked the surface, and where the fertile black
earth, fruit of years of labor, was irrevocably
buried out of sight. Before all this, in her poor,
neat black, stood the war-widow with her children.</p>

<p>I sprang forward, horrified, the tears on my
cheeks. &#8220;Oh, Madame Larconneur, how awful!
How awful!&#8221; I cried, putting out both hands
to her.</p>

<p>She turned a white, quiet face on me and
smiled, a smile that made me feel infinitely humble.
&#8220;My little girls are not hurt,&#8221; she said,
drawing them to her, &#8220;and as for all this&mdash;why,
if it is a part of getting other people&#8217;s homes
restored to them&#8221;&mdash;her gesture said that the price
was not too high.</p>

<p>The look in her sunken eyes took me for an
instant up into a very high place of courage and
steadfastness. For the first time that day, the
knot in my throat stopped aching. I was proud
to have her put her work-deformed hands in
mine and to feel on my cheeks her sister&#8217;s kiss.</p>

<p>It steadied me somewhat during the difficult
next hour, when in the falling twilight I walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
up and down between the long rows of raw earth,
with the innumerable crosses, each with its new,
bright American flag, fluttering in the sweet country
air. I needed to recall that selfless courage,
for my heart was breaking with sorrow, with
guilt-consciousness, with protest, as I stood there,
thinking of our own little son, of the mothers
of the boys who lay there.</p>

<p>A squad of soldiers were preparing graves
for the next day. As they dug in the old, old
soil of the cemetery to make a place for the new
flesh come from so far to lie there forever, a
strong odor of corruption and decay came up in
puffs and drifted away down toward the little
town lying below us, in its lovely green setting,
still shaking rhythmically to the ponderous passage
of the guns, of the troops, of the camions.</p>

<p>At one side were a few recent German graves,
marked with black crosses and others, marked
with stones, dating from the war of 1870, that
other nightmare when all this smiling countryside
was blood-soaked&mdash;and how many times before
that!</p>

<p>Above me, dominating the cemetery, stood a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
great monument of white marble, holding up to
all those graves the ironic inscription, &#8220;Love ye
one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>The twilight fell more and more deeply, and
became darkness. The dull, steady surge of the
advancing troops grew louder. Night had come,
night no longer used for rest after labor in the
sunlight, night which must be used to hurry troops
and more troops forward over roads shelled by
day.</p>

<p>They passed by hundreds, by thousands, an
endless, endless procession&mdash;horses, mules, camions,
artillery, infantry, cavalry; obscure shadowy
forms no longer in uniform, no longer from
Illinois, or Georgia or Vermont, no longer even
American; only human&mdash;young men, crowned
with the splendor of their strength, going out
gloriously through the darkness to sacrifice.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">&#8220;IT IS RATHER FOR US TO BE
HERE DEDICATED&#8221;</h2></div>

<p class="center">&#8220;<i>It is rather for us to be here dedicated....</i>&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> in the wheat-field, golden under a golden
sun, I came suddenly on the young American soldier,
lying dead, his face turned toward the <i>Bois
de Belleau</i>. He was the stillest thing in all the
silent countryside, ghostly quiet after the four-days&#8217;
din of battle, now gone forward and thundering
on the horizon. Compared to his stillness,
the wheat-stalks, broken and trampled as they
were, seemed quivering conscious life; the trees,
although half-shattered by the shell-fire, fluttered
their bright leaves, vividly alive; the weeds
by the roadside vibrated in triumph. They were
wounded, mutilated, disfigured, but they had survived.
They were alive. Only the soldier had
not survived.</p>

<p>All men go a long journey to meet their death,
through many days and months and years. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
he and his comrades had gone a longer than any
man before them. They had passed through all
those days and months and years; and more
than that, across unending miles of those other
wheat-fields in a far country and across the unending
miles of the ocean they saw for the first
time; but far more than that, they had crossed
incalculable gulfs of traditions, of prejudice, of
the tyranny of old, fixed ideas.</p>

<p>He had come a long journey, he had trod a new
road, he was fighting a new fight, this soldier
who had turned his back on the limitations of
the past, who was making forward into the future
with all the strength and faith of his young
manhood, when he met his sudden destiny and
lay down forever in a wheat-field of France.</p>

<p>There he lay in a blessed, blessed stillness, having
done his best.</p>

<p>Being still alive, and so not permitted to lie
down by him to rest, I left him, and returned to
a great city, any great city&mdash;all great cities everywhere
in the world being the same.</p>

<p>I stood before the door of a shop. I saw an
old, thin, work-deformed woman cowering before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
a well-fed man with a brutal voice who stood
over her, angrily shouting at her that she had
not sufficiently burnished the brass hinges of the
great glass doors. With the rich abundance of
the wheat-fields still golden before my eyes, I
saw her cowering before him, all her sacred human
dignity stripped from her by her need for
food, by the fear of more hunger than even she
could endure.</p>

<p>I saw a woman with a bloated, flabby body,
strained together into a cohesion by steel bands,
with a bloated, flabby face covered with red and
white. Small glass-like pieces of white stone were
thrust into the pierced flesh of her ears, gleamed
on her protuberant bosom, on her puffed, useless
fingers. With the roar of the distant battle still
in my ears, I heard her saying, &#8220;The war is lasting
too long! Lucette tells me that it&#8217;s impossible
for her to get the right shade of silk for my
corset; the only coiffeur who understands my hair
has been sent to the front; and I have not had
a bonbon in ten days.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw a wretched, disinherited son of man,
shaking with alcoholism, rotten with disease, livid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with hunger, undone with hopelessness, flung on
a bench like a ragged sack of old bones. Only
the palsied trembling of his dirty hands showed
that he lived. But with the awful odor of real
death still in my nostrils, I perceived that he was
alive, while the strong young soldier was dead.</p>

<p>I saw a man with a gross, pale countenance,
with white fine linen and smooth black broad-cloth,
who stepped confidently forward, not deigning
to lift his eyes to the crowd about him, sure
that they would give way before the costliness
of his ring and pin.</p>

<p>In his soft, white hands he held a newly printed
newspaper which, open at the news from the
stock exchange, he read with an expression of
eager rapacity. On his way stood a woman in
all the fleshly radiance of her youth, with some
of the holiness of youth still left on her painted
mouth. She, looking at him hungrily, desperately,
forced his eyes up to meet hers. With the
glory of the dead soldier still in my soul, I saw
the rapacity in his eyes change to lust, I saw
an instant&#8217;s sickness in hers go out, quenched
by the bravado of despair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>Oh, American soldier, lying still in the wheat-field
of France, did you come so far a journey
to meet your death in order that all this might
continue?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;<i>Let us here highly resolve that all these dead
shall not have died in vain....</i>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE DAY OF GLORY</h2></div>

<blockquote>
<p><i>... if the armistice is signed, a salvo of
cannon from the Invalides at eleven o&#8217;clock will
announce the end of the war.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> clock hands crept slowly past ten and
lagged intolerably thereafter. The rapid beating
of your heart, telling off the minutes, brought
eleven finally very near. Then the clock, your
heart, all the world, seemed to stand still. The
great moment was there. Would the announcing
cannon speak? Such a terrible silence as
the world kept during that supreme moment of
suspense! It was the quintessence of all the
moral torture of four nightmare years.</p>

<p>And then ... like a shock within your own
body it came, the first solemn proclamation of
the cannon, shaking the windows, the houses, the
very sky, with its news. The war was over.
The accursed guns had ceased tearing to pieces
our husbands and our sons and our fathers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>Of all the hundreds of thousands of women
who heard those guns, I think there was not one
who did not feel instantly, scalding on her
cheeks, the blessed tears&mdash;tears of joy! She had
forgotten that there could be tears of joy. The
horrible weight on the soul that had grown to
be a part of life dissolved away in that assuaging
flood; the horrible constriction around the heart
loosened. We wept with all our might; we
poured out once for all the old bitterness, the
old horror. We felt sanity coming back, and
faith and even hope, that forgotten possession of
the old days.</p>

<p>When the first tears of deliverance had passed,
and your knees had stopped shaking, and your
heart no longer beat suffocatingly in your throat,
why, then every one felt one common imperious
desire, to leave the little cramping prison of his
own walls, to escape out of the selfish circle of
his own joy, and to mingle his thanksgiving
with that of all his fellows, to make himself
physically, as he felt spiritually, at one with
rejoicing humanity.</p>

<p>And we all rushed out into the streets.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>I think there never can have been such a day
before, such a day of pure thanksgiving and joy
for every one. For the emotion was so intense
that, during the priceless hours of that first day,
it admitted no other. Human hearts could hold
no more than that great gladness. The dreadful
past, the terrible problems of the future, were
not. We lived and drew our breath only in the
knowledge that &#8220;firing had ceased at eleven
o&#8217;clock that morning,&#8221; and that those who had
fought as best they could for the Right had conquered.
You saw everywhere supreme testimony
to the nobility of the moment, women in black,
with bits of bright-colored tricolor pinned on
their long black veils, with at last a smile, the
most wonderful of all smiles, in their dimmed
eyes. They were marching with the others in
the streets; every one was marching with every
one else, arm in arm, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Allons, enfants de la patrie,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Le Jour de Gloire est arrivé!</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>The houses echoed to those words, repeated and
repeated by every band of jubilant men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
women and children who swept by, waving flags
and shouting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Come, children of our country,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The Day of Glory is here!</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Every group had at its head a permissionnaire
or two in field uniform who had been pounced
upon as the visible emblem of victory, kissed,
embraced, covered with flowers, and set in the
front rank to carry the largest flag. Sometimes
there walked beside these soldiers working
women with sleeping babies in their arms, sometimes
old men in frock coats with ribbons in
their buttonholes, sometimes light-hearted, laughing
little munition workers still in their black
aprons, but with tricolored ribbons twisted in
their hair, sometimes elegantly dressed ladies,
sometimes women in long mourning veils, sometimes
ragged old beggars, sometimes a cab filled
with crippled soldiers waving their crutches&mdash;but
all with the same face of steadfast, glowing
jubilee. During those few blessed hours there
was no bitterness, no evil arrogance, no revengeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
fury. Any one who saw all that afternoon
those thousands and thousands of human faces
all shining with the same exaltation can never
entirely despair of his fellows again, knowing
them to be capable of that pure joy.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Day of Glory has come.</i></p>

<p>The crowd seemed to be merely washing back
and forth in surging waves of thanksgiving, up
and down the streets aimlessly, carrying flowers
to no purpose but to celebrate their happiness.
But once you were in it, singing and marching
with the others, you felt an invisible current
bearing you steadily, irresistibly, in one direction;
and soon, as you marched, and grew nearer the
unknown goal, you heard another shorter, more
peremptory, rhythm mingling with the longer
shout, repeated over and over:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Allons, enfants de la patrie,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Le Jour de Gloire est arrivé!</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Now people were beginning to shout: &#8220;To
Strasbourg! To Strasbourg! To Strasbourg!
To Strasbourg!&#8221; Then you knew that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
were being swept along to the Place de la Concorde,
to salute the statue of Strasbourg, freed
from her forty years of mourning and slavery.</p>

<p>The crowd grew denser and denser as it approached
that heart of Paris; and the denser it
grew the higher flamed the great fire of rejoicing,
mounting up almost visibly to the quiet
gray skies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Come, children of our country,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The Day of Glory is here!</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;To Strasbourg! To Strasbourg! To Strasbourg!&#8221;</p>

<p>No evil epithets hurled at the defeated enemy,
not one, not one in all those long hours of shouting
out what was in the heart; no ugly effigies,
no taunting cries, no mention even of the enemy&mdash;instead
a fresh outburst of rejoicing at the
encounter with a long procession of Belgians,
marching arm in arm, carrying Belgian flags
and pealing out like trumpets the noble Brabançonne!
We made way for them with respectful
admiration, we stopped our song to listen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
theirs, we let them pass, waving our hats, our
handkerchiefs, cheering them, pressing flowers
upon them, snatching at their hands for a clasp
as they went by, blessing them for their constancy
and courage, sharing their relief till our
hearts were like to burst!</p>

<p>We fell in behind them and at once had to
separate again to allow the passage of a huge
camion, bristling with American soldiers, heaped
up in a great pyramid of brown. How every
one cheered them, a different shout, with none
of the poignant undercurrent of sympathy for
pain that had greeted the Belgian exiles. These
brave, lovable, boyish crusaders come from
across the sea for a great ideal, who had been
ready to give all, but who had been blessedly
spared the last sacrifice&mdash;it was a rollicking shout
which greeted them! They represented the
youth, the sunshine; they were loved and
laughed at and acclaimed by the crowd as they
passed, waving their caps, leaning over the side
to shake the myriad hands stretched up to them,
catching at the flowers flung at them, shouting
out some song, perhaps a college cheer, judging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by the professionally frantic gestures of a cheer
leader, grinding his teeth and waving his arms
wildly to exhort them to more volume of sound.
Whatever it was, it was quite inaudible in the
general uproar, the only coherent accent of
which was the swelling cry repeated till it was
like an elemental sound of nature.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Day of Glory has arrived.</i></p>

<p>Now a group of English soldiers overtook us,
carrying a great, red, glorious English flag,
adding some hearty, inaudible marching song to
the tumult. As they passed, a <i>poilu</i> in our band
sprang forward, seized one of the Anglo-Saxons
in his arms, and kissed him resoundingly on both
cheeks. Then there was laughter, and shouts
and handshakings and more embracing, and they
too vanished away in the waves of the great
river of humanity flowing steadily, rapidly
toward the statue of the lost city whose loss had
meant the triumph of unscrupulous force, whose
restitution meant the righting of an old wrong
in the name of justice. We were almost there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
now; the huge open <i>Place</i> opened out before
us.</p>

<p>Now we had come into it, and our songs for
an instant were cut short by one great cry of
astonishment. As far as the eye could reach,
the vast public square was black with the crowd,
and brilliant with waving flags. A band up on
the terrace of the Tuileries, stationed between
the captured German airplanes, flashed in the
air the yellow sheen of their innumerable brass
instruments, evidently playing with all their
souls, but not a sound of their music reached our
ears, so deafening was the burst of shouting and
singing as the crowd saw its goal, the high
statue of the lost city, buried in heaped-up
flowers and palms, a triumphant wreath of gold
shadowing the eyes which so long had looked
back to France from exile.</p>

<p>Ah, what an ovation we gave her! Then we
shouted as we had not done before, the great
primitive, inarticulate cry of rejoicing that
bursts from the heart too full. We shook out
our flags high over our heads, as we passed, we
cast our flowers up on the pedestal, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
swept along by the current&mdash;we were the current
ourselves!</p>

<p>At the base of the statue a group of white-haired
Alsatians stood, men and women, with
quivering lips and trembling hands. Theirs
was the honor to arrange the flowers which,
tossed too hastily by the eager bearers, fell to
the ground.</p>

<p>As they stooped for them, and reached high
to find yet one more corner not covered with
blooms, a splendid, fair-haired lad, sturdy and
tall, with the field outfit of the French soldier
heavy on his back, pushed his way through the
crowd.</p>

<p>He had in his hand a little bouquet&mdash;white
and red roses, and forget-me-nots. His eyes
were fixed on the statue. He did not see the
old men and women there to receive the flowers.
He pressed past them and with his own young
hands laid his humble offering at the feet of the
recovered city. He looked up at the statue and
his lips moved. He could not have been more
unconscious if he had been entirely alone in an
Alsatian forest. The expression of his beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
young face was such that a hush of awe fell on
those who saw him.</p>

<p>An old woman in black took his hand in hers
and said: &#8220;You are from Alsace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I escaped from Strasbourg to join the
French army,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and all my family are
there.&#8221; His eyes brimmed, his chin quivered.</p>

<p>The old woman had a noble gesture of self-forgetting
humanity. She took him in her arms
and kissed him on both cheeks. &#8220;You are my
son,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>They all crowded around him, taking his
hand. &#8220;And my brother!&#8221; &#8220;And mine!&#8221;
&#8220;And mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears ran down their cheeks.</p>
